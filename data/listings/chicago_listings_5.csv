Short walk to Fullerton or Armitage buses, just under 20 minutes walk to Blue Line el train station, also 10 minutes to nearest Metra train to downtown.
FANTASTIC bars and restaurants in neighborhood (good options within walking distance), and shopping/sites. Accessible to other parts of the city.
Chicago resident for over 10 years, so happy to provide guidance on this awesome city!

Clean and modern design, with some exotic flair from items picked up from world travels. The space for guests has standard comforts to make stay easier: shelves, hanging rack, desk & chair in guest bedroom with full size bed, and master bedroom includes a hanging rack and dresser space, ensuite master bath, and queen size bed. Both bathrooms include towels and toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hand soap, cotton balls/swabs). Bedrooms have locks for privacy. 
The living room sofa converts into a full-size bed and extra bedding is kept inside the chaise section of the sofa. There is a TV with options for watching movies and shows, and a dvd player and a Redbox dvd kiosk a few blocks away in front of Tony's grocery store. (There is an infrared sauna in the living room that can only be used with permission/release and instruction.)
The kitchen is stocked with standard amenities: stove, microwave, fridge, dishwasher, coffee maker (Ninja with latte options and French press), tea kettle, pots/pans, dishes, and free tea in the white canisters. 
Washer and dryer in unit with laundry detergent provided.
Condo equipped with high speed internet, and although I don't have cable, I have a Roku with access to Netflix, Hulu, Roku channel (and other stations). 
Grocery store within a few blocks, restaurants and bars also within walking distance, and main logan square intersection about 20 minutes walk. Farmers market there every Sunday in season as well as lots of restaurants/bars/shops/movie theater.
Comfortable, clean, cozy space in great neighborhood!

I am very friendly and social, and happy to provide recommendations and even take you out to some of my favorite spots if I'm available. Feel free to email or text with any concerns during your stay as I also live in Logan Square.

Logan Square is my favorite neighborhood in Chicago. There are so many great restaurants, including the Michelin starred restaurant Longman & Eagle, among other great dining spots, and some of the best bars in the city like Scofflaw, Best Intentions, The Whistler, Lost Lake, Revolution Brewing, etc. There is also a very popular bar a couple blocks away with huge outdoor area with bags called Park & Field that is great during nice weather. There are fun shops from resale to upscale, books stores, comic book store, arcade, movie theater all within walking distance or short drive. There's a hipster vibe but it's a diverse neighborhood. Logan Square named one of the nation's coolest neighborhoods in 2016! It's also next to fantastic and popular neighborhoods of Bucktown/Wicker Park/Humboldt Park with restaurants/shopping/parks, and easily accessible to other parts of the city.

Uber and Lyfts are plentiful, two bus stops are very close (Fullerton is a few blocks, Armitage is within 10 minutes walk), and the el train is an easy walk (15-20 minutes). There is also a Metra station 15 minutes walk north that goes downtown. There is free street parking on my street and on nearby streets, though some streets nearby require permits so check when parking. The 606 walk/bike elevated path is also very close. There are Divvy bike stations (shared bikes) to use all over the neighborhood/city including one a few blocks walk from the condo.

There is easy access to outdoor areas, including a small community park only two houses down on my corner, so please keep smoking to outside the apartment. No smoking inside. Preference is to also leave shoes by the welcome mat and not wear them inside. Please also keep noise to a minimum to be respectful of others in the building. No parties (only guests) inside condo please. Thank you!",,"I am very friendly and social, and happy to provide recommendations and even take you out to some of my favorite spots if I'm available.

Located in the Oakton Historic District, the neighborhood boasts of older homes, multi-dwelling housing, two parks, and an elementary school. The neighbors are friendly, and take great pride with maintaining their homes and yards. Enjoy a walk around the neighborhood, you will meet friendly neighbors, and you'll discover some hidden beauty in architecture, some sustainable initiatives such as perennial gardens with lots of pollinator plants, composting, and a bee-keeper.

There are two parks in close proximity to my front door.  Walk north about a block and you will discover  a basketball court, baseball diamond, and an open field for soccer.  For families with young children, just one block east is an open space with a playscape.

My home is about a 12 minute walk from the South Blvd Purple Line,  (EL) train, and a 20 minute walk from Evanston's Main St. Metra.

ENTIRE APARTMENT WITH PRIVATE ENTRANCE

If needed, I'm available in person.

Skokie lies approximately 15 miles north of Chicago's downtown loop. Skokie's streets, like that of many suburbs, are largely a continuation of the Chicago street grid, and the village is served by the Chicago Transit Authority, further cementing its connection to the city.
This is a quiet residential street.

The Location
Location really is everything, especially when it comes to modern living. The idea of a modern apartment is closely tied to city life. So for a modern look and feel, you want centrally located apartment, that is close to all of the modern luxuries the city offers: shopping, office space, transportation, parks, restaurants, and night life. Most things should be within easy walking distance or a quick bus or train ride.
This apartment is five blocks from highway I-94 EDENS. 
3 blocks from train -Skokie Swift -Dempster stop. Swift is connected with Chicago's CTA and will transport you to Chicago downtown loop

The floor plan
The floor plan itself can determine whether the interior of the apartment is modern. Our modern floor plan is typically open, minimal, and flows easily between rooms. This apartment comes with large windows and doorways, a connected dining room and kitchen, and lots of lighting. Modern floor plans are all about utilizing space and light.
   
    The Amenities
Modern apartments are known for their amenities and commodities: for example, a  free washer and dryer and fast WiFi.  If you commute to work, we included safe and convenient parking spot, just next to your apartment's door. 

   The Style
Of course, there’s the décor and the design of an apartment. Even with a great floor plan and location, the wrong décor can feel out of place.  Our apartments are bright with bright colors, interesting textures, and eclectic combinations of decorative accessories.

     The Management
Last, but not least, you’ll want to get to know the management team of the apartment complex. You may think that a modern apartment is based mostly upon what you can see on the surface, but the management is behind it all. They’re the ones who will make sure your Internet service is always working, your water is always running, and your building is always in top shape. An apartment is only as modern as its management!","Quiet hours 10pm-8am

Please read these rules carefully and take them seriously, failure to comply will result in forfeiture of your deposit and/or termination of your reservation without a refund. 

1.) No parties or additional overnight guests without prior approval. Noise disturbances reported by neighbors or police are unacceptable.
2.) Please ensure you have left the premises and returned any keys issued to you by the agreed upon check out time. Failure to do so will result in a $250 late check-out fee. 
3.) No smoking (of anything) inside the unit or on building premises. Additionally, Chicago law prohibits smoking within 15 feet of any building entrance. 
4.) Please be respectful of my neighbors and be mindful of noise and loud music. Please observe quiet hours from 10:00 PM-8:00 AM daily. 
5.) Pets are not allowed at the property.

East Lakeview is a safe, vibrant neighborhood and our condo is steps from everything. Though it's bustling with activity, we're on a nice leafy street so you'll still get a great night's sleep. With a 96 walk score it's a walkers paradise!

Here are a few of the things we love about Lakeview:

- Great restaurants and bars abound (we love Bar Pastoral, Ceres Table, Dryhop Brewing, Stan's Donuts and Uncommon Ground), all within an easy walk.

- Great coffee shops (boutique gems like Intelligentsia, solid nationals like Peets and Starbucks) are around the corner.

- Wrigley Field and the Wrigleyville bars and restaurants, about a 15 minute walk away.

- All the glitz and excitement of the Boystown neighborhood is a 5-8 minute walk away.

- A full-service Mariano's grocery store is just around the corner, and Whole Foods is a 5 minute drive away. Great neighborhood amenities like Trader Joe's, Walgreens, CVS, dry cleaners, salons, etc are all within a block or so. Plus we are a few blocks from the small but cute Nettelhorst Farmers Market (open Saturday mornings through October)!

- The lakefront and Lincoln Park are a 5 minute walk away. Great for hitting the beach, running and biking, or just enjoying the greenery and the sunshine!

There are a multitude of ways to get around. 

- Ubers and taxis are plentiful at all hours.

- The major bus lines (22 Clark, 8 Halsted, 36 Broadway, 151 Sheridan, etc) are all within one to three blocks of our condo and can take you anywhere in the city!

- The Brown and Purple line Wellington El stop is just a 5-8 minute walk.

- The Red, Brown and Purple line Belmont El stop is also about a 5-8 minute walk away.

-Divvy bike-sharing station at the end of our block.

- The Loop downtown area is about a 15-20 minute drive down Lake Shore Drive and the McCormick Place convention center is just a 20-25 minute drive down Lake Shore Drive (depending on the time of day).

- We do have a garage parking space, though please keep in mind that it is ""city sized"" and will fit cars very well though not larger SUVs. We also have overnight street parking permits for our guests!","- Check-in time is 3:00 pm. Let us know if you need a different time and we'll do our best to accommodate.

- Please be respectful of our neighbors, and please remove your shoes when inside. Smoking is not allowed  in the building. No pets or illegal drugs please.

- Our building has required quiet hours from 10:00 pm to 8:30 am. No loud conversations, TV, music, or anything like that during those hours please. 

- This is a great space for a fun trip or extended work assignment, but not the right place for parties.

- Above all, have a great time!!","We will meet you at our place for check-in and a quick tour. We live and work close by, and are available to help with anything you may need!

A separate side entrance leads to mud room & interior door, then living room with TV, sofabed & elliptical. Bedroom has queen and double beds. Down the hall is a full kitchen and bath with shower & tub. Great neighborhood - just 5-minute walk to park, playground, waterpark, and fitness center. The Blue Line train to city, grocery stores and restaurants are all within a 10-minute walk. 15-minute drive to downtown.

Full kitchen with stove, refrigerator, coffee-maker, microwave and breakfast table. Spacious living room with TV (basic cable channels + Amazon Fire Stick) and comfy couch and gym-quality elliptical trainer. Electric fireplace/heater. Full tub and shower in bathroom. One queen and one double bed in bedroom. 

This apartment is completely private - you have your own entrance with key from coded lock box and are separated from the rest of the house. You'll only see us if you want to come visit! It is in the basement of an old house and we have a three-year old and dog upstairs, so you’ll hear that pitter-patter, but we go to bed early and don’t have big parties. 

The location is also great. Easy transport to and from O'hare or Midway and less than ten minute walk to Blue Line, which gets you downtown in 40 minutes. Forest Park itself is very nice with plenty of restaurants and parks. Close to Loyola Medical School.

Our family of three, plus peaceful dog live upstairs.  We are available on the spot, but will not intrude on guests unless needed/requested. If we happen to be out of town, then we will have our neighbor available. Private entrance and locked doors separate the suite. It’s an old house so you will likely hear us walking around upstairs, but we do not host parties or stay up late, so it shouldn't bother you. Also it's not possible to bother us with noise, so no worries about getting loud.

Quiet and safe neighborhood with easy access to Blue Line of the ""L train"" to downtown Chicago. Walking distance to a ton of recreational and commercial opportunities including the Forest Park water park, just three blocks away. Park includes huge pools, play areas and waterslides.

Walk to everything you need. Street parking is free and always available  directly in front of the apartment. You do need to register your license plate with the village by phone or online (this is also free and directions and reminders will be sent!) Train station and bus stops all within 5-7 minute walk.

Early check-in and late checkout are often possible (especially during the weekdays) - just ask!

If you want to get off the beaten path a little bit more, you can always catch a city bus just about a block away.

I am available to answer any questions or concerns if you message me on Airbnb

Bordering Lake Michigan on the north side of Chicago directly above Lincoln Park, Lakeview is home to a popular destination: Wrigley Field. Originally built in 1914 for Federal Leagues Chicago Whales, Wrigley Field is one the oldest still-operating stadiums in the MLB. It was renamed Wrigley Field in 1926 by then-owner William Wrigley Jr., a chewing gum manufacturer.

Of course, there's more to Lakeview than baseball. From the luxury high-rise apartments along Lake Shore Drive to the tree-filled streets and single-family homes in Graceland West, there's something for everyone in Lakeview. This large neighborhood consists of several smaller enclaves, including Wrigleyville, Boystown, and North Halsted. Lakeview features several theaters, such as the Music Box Theater and the Playground Theater, as well as music venues and shops. On the south end of the neighborhood, Lincoln Park is home to the Lincoln Park Zoo, a nine-hole golf course, a dog beach, and jogging trails.

A piece of cake, Near Belmont station, where you can pick up the red or brown line el trains to downtown. Divvy bike rental on the corner. There is also the Belmont bus that runs east and west, you can take to go to Lake Michigan/Lincoln Park. Of course Uber and Lyft are prevalent in my hood.

I have a washer and dryer in the unit. Free WiFi available","- 10pm-6am quiet hours, please take shoes off at the door.",I am available to answer any questions or concerns if you message me on Airbnb,"Bordering Lake Michigan on the north side of Chicago directly above Lincoln Park, Lakeview is home to a popular destination: Wrigley Field.

Check out our store online @marinelayer!

While Marine Layer is still just a clothing company, The Loft is our take on a rad place to hang your hat while you visit Chicago. Pretty much, it's a Mad Men styled apartment nestled above our store of absurdly soft shirts.

You'll have your own entry to the loft.

Our store is right under the loft, and you're always welcome to pop by (and shop with a 15% discount). But otherwise, we'll stay out of your hair.


Store hours are 10am-8pm daily

Bucktown is one of the friendliest neighborhoods in Chicago. Damen Ave is riddled with small businesses and local restaurants for you to check out. If it's live music, good food, or a party you're looking to have Bucktown has it all! It's got the big city culture with the small town feel.

We have a variety of options for street parking conveniently located within walking distance from the ML Loft. A map of said streets will be provided to you upon your arrival. 

No car? No problem!

Step 1) Head to your nearest 24 hour Walgreens (conveniently located just a few blocks away) or your local CTA train station (The Damen Blue Line Station is also conveniently located just a few blocks away) and get yourself a Ventra card from one of the Ventra card vendors. One of the CTA personnel will be around to assist you if need be. 

Step 2) Load a 1, 3, or 7 day pass onto your Ventra card. 

Step 3) You now have unlimited rides on both the CTA bus and train system!

Even though this is a larger space, there is not a full kitchen, just a kitchenette. And the bathroom is not so spacious. Take a look at the pictures and let us know if you have any questions about the amenities.","We're all about bending the rules, but in this case, please leave the place as you found it. 

1) Place all dirty sheets and towels in the laundry bag (located in the bathroom)

2) Put all dirty dishes in the sink

3) Leave keys on the mini bar or with ML employee. There is a $10 fee for any keys that are lost or not returned upon your check out. 

4) Lock the door handle and dead bolt on your way out

5) No smoking allowed

6) No pets allowed","Our store is right under the loft, and you're always welcome to pop by (and shop with a 15% discount). But otherwise, we'll stay out of your hair.

I can help you find stuff if you like, navigate transportation if needed. We can chat or not, whatever your style is.

When choosing and rating my location, please understand this about my neighborhood: it is not an upscale neighborhood, but my street is very nice with a few run down looking places in the mix. I see myself as part of the solution. I love it here because it is not crowded, and it is so close to downtown. I walk around at night, but I am sensible about it.
The train station area is crummy looking, let's admit it. Don't judge me or my street by that! most train stations are a little run down.
My area is adjacent to so much. Garfield Park Conservatory is near, United Center, Humboldt Park, Ukrainian Village are about a mile or so away. There are great spots to eat all along Chicago Avenue, California and Division both have lots of neighborhood eateries and bars, funky boutiques. Logan Square is a short ride away, with all it's hot spots. And of course access to downtown with all it's high end shopping, attractions, and the Lake! is just east of me easily accessible by train. Save your parking money for shopping eating and having fun!

CTA Route 94 South California stops at the front door. 
To the south 2 stops, it goes right to the Green Line train, at the California station. 
To the north 2 stops, it connects to CTA Bus Route 66 Chicago Ave bus and the 52 North California bus route. Very easy. 
Uber and Lyft both come here happily, and I have a good relationship with the drivers that I get often. 
There is a bike rental (Divvy) right by the California train stop, and one a block north of me at a green center. I have my own bike so I haven't used Divvy, but there are racks all over the city to rent it or return it. You can also take a bike on the bus, loaded on the front rack, or on the train if it is not rush hour.

Our neighborhood is on the edge of what used to be an industrial corridor, now transitioning to being used for artsy offices and band practice lofts, breweries and artsy places to have weddings and such. Houses up and down the street are being cleaned up fixed up daily. Whereas it is not a POSH upscale neighborhood, a new private school across the street a couple years ago gave the whole area an upswing, but we can still park free!","Smoking section is out on the porch. 
Responsible enjoyment of alcohol.
No other pets please. 
Please lock the doors behind you when entering and exiting. If I am not home when you check out, you may leave the keys in the mailbox on the front gate.
Do not leave the air conditioning on in your room when you are not home.
Please respect our neighbors and keep it down some. 
Do not cook meat here. Eat it if you want, but cook it elsewhere.
Please leave things tidy.
If your shoes are wet or muddy please take them off. Otherwise, do as you would at home.","I can help you find stuff if you like, navigate transportation if needed.

Outside is a small deck, grill, and a table and chairs for entertaining.   Inside, on the first level is a TV and entertainment center.  Netflix, Amazon Prime, a Chromecast, and broadcast channels are available.  Also on the first level is a large stove.

The bedroom itself is on the upper level of the duplex.  It can be accessed in two ways: through the main entrances of the apartment and up the stairs, or separately through the common area.  Both doors have locks.","One room in a lovely duplex up, this is a great place to stay if you're exploring the neighborhoods, or if you want easy access to downtown without the noise and hustle.

Great location! A 5 minute walk from Wicker Park at Division St and Milwaukee Ave, as well as booming Chicago Ave and West Town, and Eckhart Park.

Getting downtown or to other neighborhoods is easy: the Ashland bus is around the corner and the Blue Line 5 minutes away on foot.

Converted to a duplex condo about 15 years ago, there are two bedrooms and one bathroom on the upper level.  The duplex is on the top (third) floor of a multi-unit building (walk-up; no elevator).  On the lower level is a lovely kitchen, large living and outdoor space.  In nice weather, this is an optimal place to have some drinks, grill food, catch some sun and breeze, or just relax.

Regardless of what you are looking for in the city, getting there should not be a problem.  Besides access to public transportation, the duplex is close to several Divvy stations and close to the famous ""Hipster Highway"", Milwaukee Ave, on which you can get directly to downtown or away from downtown into Wicker Park and Logan Square, or all the way out to O'Hare.

I rent my condo when I am traveling, so I will usually be unavailable for anything that needs personal interaction.  However, I am always willing to answer a call or text with any recommendations, concerns or other issues.

Wicker Park is known for it's shopping, restaurants, coffee shops and nightlife.  

West Town includes Ukranian Village and East Village, and I've been impressed with the sheer quantity of dining options in the area.

Public transportation has you covered:  
The apartment is within walking distance (~5 min) of the Blue Line at Division.  From there, the rest of the city is accessible on the L.  Common destinations from the Blue Line are Logan Square, O'Hare, or the Loop.
Besides trains, just steps outside of the apartment is the Ashland #9 bus, which can take you as far North or South as you need to go.  The Division #70 and Chicago #66 bus lines are both about 5 minutes away as well.

West Town is popular for it's bike lanes, so if you get around on two wheels you are in luck.  Augusta, Division, Milwaukee and Wood are just a few of the nearby streets with good bike lanes.  Divvy bike share has several stations nearby.

We insist on a complete profile, so if you are new to airbnb please fill yours out. When you email please tell me a little bit about yourself and your trip. We do live here and have a child, so we want to know who you are. Your photo should be YOU, not your pet, your child or your favorite food.

Airbnb has made changes that us host will not see your photos until the booking is completed.  We want to reiterate that we insist that your photo is clear and visibly you.  When arriving we will be using your profile or guests’ photos to confirm who you are for our safety.  By booking you agree that this is completed.  If this is not completed by the time of the booking, we reserve the right to cancel the reservation at any time.  Please note, we have had hundreds of happy guests that stayed with us over the years.  We just happen to not agree with Airbnb’s new policy to show guest photo’s until after a booking is completed.  For us, this is all about transparency of knowing who we let into our home.

The number of occupancy can not exceed the total number of guests on the reservation, unless pre-approved by the host prior to arrival.  Sorry, our home is not meant for parties for unapproved guests and additional guests sleeping for free is not ok.

Only if you like

I love that we have a 24 hour subway station (Logan Square Blue Line) at my doorstep, it's like having your own chauffeur! The best part is, it's underground, so there's no train noises like other places near the transit! There are tons restaurants, bars, coffee shops, movie theater, shopping, farmers market (during summer),  salons, banks, and many more business  all within a block from our home. Not to mention parks and a divvy bike station where you can pick up a bike anytime, and go on the riding trail only a mile away.

Its a straight shot from O'hare airport on the blue line. Its the only one of two lines that operate 24 hrs a day. Its about a 20 minute train ride to our house. From there you only need to cross the street and you are here!! 
From Midway airport, you get on the orange line to the loop and then transfer to the blue line, it takes about 35 minutes. There is also a rent a car station via zip car and enterprise just across the street.
You will never have to worry about traffic coming or going to downtown, which is about 15 minutes on the transit.

Parking Passes:  We do live in a zoned residential parking.  The residential parking number is ""96"".  This basically applies to all streets that are north and south bound on our block.  Let us know that you have a car(s) and we will leave parking stickers that are good for 24 hours per pass on the dining room table.

There are ""external"" building security cameras for the front and back porch common building spaces.","We are a smoke free and pet free home. Be respectful of our neighbors and keep the noise level at a minimum.

We insist on a complete profile, so if you are new to airbnb please fill yours out. When you email please tell me a little bit about yourself and your trip. We do live here and have a child, so we want to know who you are. Your photo should be YOU, not your pet, your child or your favorite food.

Airbnb has made changes that us host will not see your photos until the booking is completed.  We want to reiterate that we insist that your photo is clear and visibly you.  When arriving we will be using your profile or guests’ photos to confirm who you are for our safety.  By booking you agree that this is completed.  If this is not completed by the time of the booking, we reserve the right to cancel the reservation at any time.  Please note, we have had hundreds of happy guests that stayed with us over the years.  We just happen to not agree with Airbnb’s new policy to show guest photo’s until after a booking is completed.  For us, this is all about transparency of knowing who we let into our home.

The number of occupancy can not exceed the total number of guests on the reservation, unless pre-approved by the host prior to arrival.  Sorry, our home is not meant for parties for unapproved guests and additional guests sleeping for free is not ok.

There are exterior cameras outside of the units that monitor the front door and backyard patio.

Quite hours are after 10:00 PM. 

When coming and going through the front or rear, please keep the doors locked at all times.

Otherwise my house is your house, enjoy your stay!!

As Chicago's official downtown area, the Loop is one of the most important central business districts on the globe. In addition to its dynamic architecture and buzzing atmosphere, the area has an incredible concentration of cultural institutions, urban park spaces, award-winning restaurants and a shopper's paradise on State Street.

Famous for its striking architecture, the Loop vaunts signature buildings by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Louis Henri Sullivan, as well as Aqua by modern day prodigy Jeanne Gang. The area hangout, Millennium Park, complements its surrounding with stunning architectural marvels of its own. The park's crown jewels include a Frank Gehry-designed amphitheater and Cloud Gate, the landmark ""Bean"" that's become an iconic symbol of Chicago. Nearby Maggie Daley Park and the Chicago Riverwalk are two new engaging outdoor spaces that embrace design — and fun!

Off the dining area, we have a bedroom with two Twin-sized beds (and its own door to the terrace!) A hallway off the living room leads to a full-bath, as well as the master suite with ensuite bath.

You'll have full access to my 2 bedroom, 2 bath home with private terrace.

From artsy to affluent, this historic neighborhood has been home to many disparate groups over the years. An incredibly popular neighborhood destination, largely because of its proximity to the lake and downtown, Old Town keeps up a lively pace day and night. Victorian-era buildings, brick alleyways and narrow, tree-lined streets are charming backdrops to a busy main strip that runs along Wells Street between North Avenue and Division Street.

We have an outstanding ""walk score"" of 98!
My place is 5 minutes' walk away from the Sedgwick Brown/Purple line train station, and equally convenient to the North Ave. and LaSalle buses - it's almost more convenient to not have a car here! If you do bring your car, however, it's pretty easy to find garage parking around the condo.

The building shares a wall with a gym - you may hear a class happening in the hallway, but not in our home.","House Rules: Very simply, please respect my home and my neighbors.

The house is in east Old Town- best neighborhood in Chicago for both families or if you are looking to have fun. While the street itself is very quiet, tree lined and barely has cars passing by, as soon as you turn the corner, you are in the center of everything! Wells street restaurants and bars are steps away. Lincoln Park with the zoo, farm, pond, open spaces and farmers market is a 7-10 min. walk. North avenue beach is the same distance. It is perfect for walks, picnics, boat rides or good old fun in the sand. The beaches are free to the public and have breathtaking city views. Grocery shopping is made easy, seeing as Plum Market, Treasure Island and Jewel are located right in the neighborhood. Nearby coffee shops include a 24 hour Starbucks and La Fournette. There are 103 restaurants within a 15 minute walk including some of Chicago's top restaurants including Kamehachi, Topo Gigio, The Fireplace Inn, and Woodies Flat. Bars and lounges are abundant on Wells and are all 1-2 minute walk. Shopping in Old Town is a unique experience; the majority of shops in this neighborhood are boutiques rather than well-known chain stores. Therefore, each and every store is cozy, intimate and filled with one-of-a-kind goods. The Lincoln Park Zoo is a world of wildlife in the shadow of skyscrapers. The Second City only two blocks away and it is a famous theater that specializes in sketch comedy and improv, and has been delighting audiences for over 50 years. Oak street and beginning of Michigan avenue is about 15-20 minute walk.

The house is a six minute walk from the Brown Line and the Purple Line at the Sedgwick stop and an eight minute walk from Red line at Clark. It takes be about 15 min to walk to Michigan Ave and Wells street bars are a minute away. Buses and cabs are also easily accessible. It is about a 3 minute drive to get onto Lake Shore drive at LaSalle and about 8 minutes to Kennedy expressway at North Avenue

"1) Smoking and vaping are only allowed on your private balcony with the balcony door shut. The rest of the property is smoke and vapor free. We have marijuana and tobacco chemical sensors on the property. They know it's not cooking smoke, They react to airborne particulate, not the smell on your clothes. The PolySens® technology works, so exit the building if you want to smoke/vape or you'll be fined $500 and asked to leave.

2) Your reservation has paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number, whether visiting or sleeping, you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first.

3) Quiet hours are 10PM-8AM. Noise should not be heard coming from your apartment. This is a quiet residential building. 95% of our guests have no issues, and never hear from us. We will be sure to send you at least 2 warnings prior to asking anyone to leave, but one way or another, the apartment must be quiet.

4) Parties, events, and commercial activity are not allowed.

5) We reserve the right to ask you to leave without a refund if any of the above rules are broken.

6) Lost keys will incur a $100 charge. We have to change the locks. Please use the app to send a picture of all the keys at check-in AND check-out.

7) Our favorite restaurant in Chicago is La Scarola.


Privacy Statement on the Use of Security Cameras:
We respect and value the privacy of our guests. We will never place a camera inside a living space. While Airbnb policy allows cameras in spaces that are not used for sleeping or bathing, we disagree. Cameras should be banned from inside all living spaces. Footage should be automatically deleted. Everything should be disclosed in advance. We use hallway security cameras to verify the number of guests who have entered an apartment. This is useful for stopping parties, and under additional prices extra guest charges may apply for extra people sleeping over.  All footage is deleted automatically after a stay, unless there is an open resolution center case. It’s unfortunate that not every guest is honest about their intentions, and our community would not allow us to be on Airbnb if we did not prevent unwanted behaviors. Let us know if you have questions.

Not just a private patio, but a skyline view roof deck. Skip the cheap apartments with good photos and fake finishes; this ultra luxurious condo is the real deal!

Flooded with natural light and ceilings that soar to 11 feet, the feeling is airy, spacious, modern, ultra luxury.  This is a brand new building from the ground up in 2018! Not just a bathtub, but a deep soaking tub big enough for boobs and knees.  Not just a shower, but a custom glass rain shower large enough to spin around.  Enjoy a private patio with actual privacy, a public skyline view roof deck that isn't a sales pitch or a party, a 24 hour gym with lots of equipment and space to move around, blazingly fast WiFi, a wealth of coffee options/equipment, this space goes so far above and beyond what you'll find in a hotel.  Prepare to be shocked, then amazed, and then just happy.

PARKING
There are a limited number of parking spaces on site, and they do fill up. They are assigned in order of request by guests with confirmed reservations. 

Please also let me know - what rental category vehicle are you parking? Size restrictions apply, and I need to know the rental category you’ve chosen, even if you aren’t sure of the exact model. (Examples include compact car, full-size SUV, and minivan.)

For additional parking, there’s a garage next door, less than a minute walk, that is very reasonable and super convenient!
----------
CHECK-IN TIME 
Typically, guests may receive the keys and drop their bags in the condo as early as 12PM (noon). The cleaners do need until 4PM to do their work. 
If you'd like to drop your bags early, we can usually accommodate you!
 If you'd like to take a nap or shower right away, and the night before your stay isn't booked yet, let's discuss booking that night before! Then you could arrive as early as you'd like that day! 
----------
CHECK-OUT TIME
11AM is check-out. If you'll need a check-out after 11AM, and the night after your stay isn't booked yet, let's chat about booking that next night! Then you could leave as late as you'd like that day!
Unfortunately we *do not* have anywhere to hold bags after your stay - sorry!
----------
ROLLAWAY BED
The twin rollaway bed is prepared before every stay with fresh linens.
The bed is physically locked into the upright position to help make the bed super easy to move around, and placed in the closet. Simply roll it into place and open. Everything will be ready for you.
----------
OCCUPANCY 
Upon booking, your reservation will have paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number whether visiting or sleeping,  you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first. 
We consider the maximum capacity of the apartment to be its sleeping capacity - eight individuals. Anyone past eight would not be permitted. 
Enjoy the city! Please don’t bring a party back.
----------
RATES
Rates and minimum stays change constantly - every night is different! 
The nightly rate may change based on number of guests, which is verified upon arrival. Please do your best to let me know how many guests will be staying in advance!
----------
We have several condos in the same building - each is its own space!
Feel free to inquire about renting multiple units together!

The entire condo is yours during your stay! You will not share this condo with anyone outside of your own group!

The roof deck, the gym, the garage, and the lobby are shared spaces and you should be respectful of that.  

Guests may drop off their bags as early as 12PM (noon), after which time we ask that you leave the condo until 4PM to let the cleaners finish cleaning. It's hard to wash the sheets with someone taking a nap! After 4PM, the place is all yours!

I love my guests! I am available to my guests! I text my guests most of what they need! I need a number to reach you at! Please confirm your phone number and email address.

IF YOU WILL NOT HAVE A US PHONE NUMBER, please download the WHATSAPP phone texting app!

Unless you have plans at the Children's Museum, Shakespeare Theater, or Imax theater - seriously, skip it. Ask us for recommendations instead.

Parking is subject to availability - I have more condos than spots.

We do not accept instant bookings from residents of the Chicago metropolitan area as identified by profile city or phone number area code. If you live near Chicago and would like to book a stay, please send us a message with a little more information about your plans.

Immediately after booking, we will send you a few questions about your arrival time, contact info, number of guests/visitors, and to name our favorite restaurant, which is listed at the bottom of the house rules. Guests will not be allowed to check in without providing complete answers","1) Smoking and vaping are only allowed on your private balcony with the balcony door shut. The rest of the property is smoke and vapor free. We have marijuana and tobacco chemical sensors on the property. They know it's not cooking smoke, They react to airborne particulate, not the smell on your clothes. The PolySens® technology works, so exit the building if you want to smoke/vape or you'll be fined $500 and asked to leave.

2) Your reservation has paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number, whether visiting or sleeping, you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first.

3) Quiet hours are 10PM-8AM. Noise should not be heard coming from your apartment. This is a quiet residential building. 95% of our guests have no issues, and never hear from us. We will be sure to send you at least 2 warnings prior to asking anyone to leave, but one way or another, the apartment must be quiet.

4) Parties, events, and commercial activity are not allowed.

5) We reserve the right to ask you to leave without a refund if any of the above rules are broken.

6) Lost keys will incur a $100 charge. We have to change the locks. Please use the app to send a picture of all the keys at check-in AND check-out.

7) Our favorite restaurant in Chicago is La Scarola.


Privacy Statement on the Use of Security Cameras:
We respect and value the privacy of our guests. We will never place a camera inside a living space. While Airbnb policy allows cameras in spaces that are not used for sleeping or bathing, we disagree. Cameras should be banned from inside all living spaces. Footage should be automatically deleted. Everything should be disclosed in advance. We use hallway security cameras to verify the number of guests who have entered an apartment. This is useful for stopping parties, and under additional prices extra guest charges may apply for extra people sleeping over.  All footage is deleted automatically after a stay, unless there is an open resolution center case. It’s unfortunate that not every guest is honest about their intentions, and our community would not allow us to be on Airbnb if we did not prevent unwanted behaviors. Let us know if you have questions. We have nothing to hide.","I love my guests! I am available to my guests! I text my guests most of what they need! I need a number to reach you at!

This is a brand new building from the ground up in 2018! Not just a bathtub, but a deep soaking tub big enough for boobs and knees.  Not just a shower, but a custom glass rain shower large enough to spin around.  Enjoy a private patio with actual privacy, a public skyline view roof deck that isn't a sales pitch or a party, a 24 hour gym with lots of equipment and space to move around, blazingly fast WiFi, a wealth of coffee options/equipment, this space goes so far above and beyond what you'll find in a hotel.  Prepare to be shocked, then amazed, and then just happy.

As Chicago's official downtown area, the Loop is one of the most important central business districts on the globe. In addition to its dynamic architecture and buzzing atmosphere, the area has an incredible concentration of cultural institutions, urban park spaces, award-winning restaurants and a shopper's paradise on State Street.
Famous for its striking architecture, the Loop vaunts signature buildings by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Louis Henri Sullivan, as well as Aqua by modern day prodigy Jeanne Gang. The area hangout, Millennium Park, complements its surrounding with stunning architectural marvels of its own. The park's crown jewels include a Frank Gehry-designed amphitheater and Cloud Gate, the landmark ""Bean"" that's become an iconic symbol of Chicago. Nearby Maggie Daley Park and the Chicago Riverwalk are two new engaging outdoor spaces that embrace design — and fun!
In addition to architectural marvels, Chicago's cultural attractions also have a prevailing presence in the downtown Loop. The celebrated Theater District buzzes with Tony Award-winning shows and glittering marquees. The Chicago Cultural Center provides an incredible range of performance and visual arts, while the Art Institute of Chicago is widely considered to be one of the finest institutions of its kind in the world.

You are on the edge of two of the best neighborhoods in Chicago: The Gold Coast and Old Town! You are just north of downtown Chicago, and nestled against the Lake Michigan shoreline. As the name would imply, the area is one of the country's most affluent neighborhoods. With streets that are lined with historic mansions and specialty boutiques, the Gold Coast is an intensely popular area for residents and visitors.

Branching off of The Magnificent Mile is Oak Street, an upscale shopper's dream. The retail revelry includes internationally recognized stores, swanky boutiques and rare, designer fashions. If carrying around loaded shopping bags makes you hungry, you can stop at one of the district's many celebrated restaurants, including Michelin-starred winners and classic Chicago steakhouses.

A day of shopping becomes a night of revelry on the neighborhood's fabled Rush Street. Amongst the prestigious hotels and celebrated eateries, you will find a trove of booming nightlife hot spots and high-energy events. Treat yourself to the Gold Coast, you deserve it!

We recommend walking since everything you would need is so close by! 

The Clark/Division Red line stop is right across the street! This gives you easy access to downtown Chicago in 10 minutes and the beach in 15 minutes! 

The highway is a short distance away if you are driving and an Uber is readily available for longer distances.

Worried about parking? Don't be! We have 1 parking spot in the back for you :). Fair warning: it is a tight squeeze.","PLEASE NOTE THAT WE CHARGE PER GUEST AFTER A SET NUMBER. PLEASE PROVIDE THE ENTIRE GROUP COUNT IN YOUR RESERVATION REQUEST. IF AN UPDATE TO THE GROUP COUNT IS NEEDED AFTER CONFIRMING THE RESERVATION, THE RESERVATION COST MAY INCREASE.

There are numerous bakeries, boutique stores, theaters, and lively bars and restaurants. If you do feel like venturing out of the neighborhood, Lakeview is very centrally located. Head south to visit Lincoln Park, River North, and the Loop, or west to visit Buck Town or Logan square. Within minutes in a cab, you can be in any of these places.

PARKING 
There is free, public street parking in the area with no permit required. Please note that this means you may have to circle the block a few times to find a spot. There is also metered parking on a nearby street, and that becomes free from 6pm-9am daily. If you prefer paid parking for your additional vehicles, I recommend using Spot-Hero to find nearby options that work for you. Once you're here, public transportation and/or Uber are the easiest ways to get around the city.

Lakeview
Share this post:
Why we love it
Lakeview’s laidback atmosphere and picture-perfect shoreline make it a favorite hang out among locals. And spots like lively Wrigleyville and the Belmont Theater District make it a major entertainment hub, too.

Insider tips
Anchored by a beautiful stretch of shoreline to the east, Lakeview melds several distinct areas — East Lakeview, Central Lakeview, Boystown, and Wrigleyville. Each spot has its own unique character, but they’re all pulled together by Lakeview’s casual, welcoming feel.

Hit the bustling shopping districts along Broadway in East Lakeview, along Belmont near Boystown, and the bustling Southport Corridor for local boutiques, record shops, and vintage treasure hunting. Or live it up with the locals at the seemingly endless array of bars and pubs, and the dozens of much-loved neighborhood restaurants that lie in between.

Lakeview is also known as a go-to for arts and culture — you’ll find live music venues, summer street festivals, and a thriving theatre, dance, and comedy scene. Blue Man Group is a world-famous troupe that brings music, comedy, and performance art together in one unforgettable show (if you’re sitting in the “Splash Zone”, you’ll want to put on that waterproof poncho).

On a nice day, walk east until you hit Lake Michigan. That’s where you’ll find a 1,200-acre outdoor oasis, featuring the scenic Lakefront Trail, a golf course and driving range, a boat harbor, tennis courts, and grassy fields perfect for picnicking.

Explore like a local
Grab a cup of award-winning coffee, and maybe splurge on a custom-made cruiser, at Heritage Bicycles. Enjoy craft beer, a live organist, and vintage surroundings at the Music Box Theatre. Visit the museum-like showroom at Chicago Music Exchange for a tour of one of the world’s premier vintage guitar collections.",,,"Lakeview

One of Chicago's creative epicenters lies just outside downtown Chicago in Wicker Park and Bucktown. These synonymous neighborhoods are famous for live music and nightlife, chef-driven restaurants and countless art galleries — many housed within the Flat Iron Arts Building. If you have an acute knowledge of craft cocktails or an affinity for coffee, plus want to sift through records or thrifted threads, there's no better area to sip and shop in the country.

We're just steps to the Damen and Fullerton buses, and a 15 minute walk to the Clybourn Metra station - you won't have any trouble getting around town without a car from here! If you do bring your car, however, there's plenty of street parking in the neighborhood.","- House Rules: Very simply, please respect my home and my neighbors.

I will always be available to answer any questions or concerns if you message me on AirBnB.  I live next door and I  look forward to sharing any information I can provide regarding your stay in Chicago!

Before you book please read the reviews to ensure this location meets your travel style.  I work very hard to provide a clean affordable place to stay. However this is NOT the trendy West Loop area. This is a gentrifying neighborhood.  We do have a  very large multinational Fresh Food Market a few blocks from the house, some fast food and a pharmacy. We do NOT  have any trendy cafes or restaurants within walking distance, however we do boarder the trendy West Loop neighborhood and we are ONE BLOCK WALK TO  THE GREEN LINE TRAIN with  ONE TRAIN STOP  to  many Chicago attractions including the United Center, Union Park,  and the West Loop -  Randolph Street restaurants bars and shopping.  10 minutes Train ride to downtown Chicago and the Theater District/Michigan. 
So please please do not book and  rate us 2 stars for location. If you prefer to be right in the West Loop neighborhood look east on the map. This is a large, nice, clean, affordable, alternative to pricey neighborhoods if you are ok with not walking directly to Chicago attractions and your travel style allows for a gentrifying  city neighborhood.  See ""getting around"" info.

We are very centrally located. Uber and Lyft provide very reasonable options to travel to many close neighborhoods such as the Loop,  West Town, West Loop, Ukrainian Village, Wicker Park and Bucktown. This is the best option in the evening, especially with 4 or more people.  You are a $10 ride from many tourist attractions.   We are a few blocks from I-290 expressway. We are one block to CTA Green line ""L"" train with one stop to Union Park, one stop to the United Center and 2 stops to the  West Loop . You are a 12 minute Train ride ( 3 stops) to downtown Chicago Loop , Michigan Avenue , Grant Park and Millennium Park and the Lake.  We are located 3 miles west of Lake Michigan. 

Airports
Ohare and Midway are about a half hour ride ( pending traffic) 
and cost about $20. Also easy by public transportation. 

Ohare - is Blue Line ( follow signs for trains to city) Transfer at State & Lake to Green line and get off at California stop .  

Midway  is Orange line. Transfer at State and Lake  to Green line and off at California stop. 

We are 2 block  walk from California Green line train stop. 

I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY TRAVEL QUESTIONS!

We do not host  parties or events and no guests that are not on reservation.  This is a residential neighborhood. If you live in Chicago please message me before instant booking.

We live upstairs so we are always available for questions, recommendations or just plain good ole conversations. We always respond pretty quickly to issues and having owned the building for quite some time have become pretty handy so we can take care of most repairs.

All the great restaurants and bars are on 18th street and all walking distance. We also have a cool small bar just around the corner, which is great for getting some drinks with a friend when you don't want to travel too far but still want to get out. There are great little local grocery stores, but we also have a Target a short bus ride south (if you didnt want to walk there) and we have an ALDI a short walking distance. 
We are close to UIC as well as a short bus ride to the United Center and to Chinatown!

We are close to two major expressways I55 and I290.
I55 goes into Downtown and out to Bolingbrook, Argonne National Laboratory, and all the way to Springfield (southwest).
I290 goes into Downtown and out west Chicago Premium Outlet Mall, Aurora and to Dekalb (west). 
If you are sticking around town, you can just take the Pink Line to Medical District or Downtown.  We also have the 18th bus that can take you to south loop and the Museum Campus/Soldier Field or take the Damen bus to United Center or to Wicker Park!

Jan-Feb Stay 7+ nights at 20% off OR 30+ at 25% off! 

My (recently redecorated!) one bedroom actually has two beds - and the day bed is very comfortable! I'm only a couple of miles from the Loop, so this is a great location whether you're in town for business or to see the sights (Navy Pier is only a few miles east.) The neighborhood itself is vibrant, with plenty of restaurants and shops, and I'm close to the Blue and Green lines. What a location! Book today!

You'll enter - via private entrance - into an open living room / kitchen. In a nook off the kitchen is the day bed. Down the hall is the Queen-sized bedroom, full bathroom, and washer and dryer.

You'll have full access to my one-bedroom apartment.

This apartment is located in West Town, an area just northwest of the Loop. It was originally part of Chicago's famous Polish Downtown. Because of this, it has a community vibe and is full of rich history. Shops, restaurants, and bars are within walking distance of the apartment. Other nearby neighborhoods include River West and Noble Square.

There are several bus lines located on the adjacent Ashland Avenue and Chicago Avenue. The Chicago Ave (Blue line) train stop and Ashland (Green/Pink lines) train stop, which can take you to downtown Chicago, are each a few blocks away. If you have a car, the Kennedy Expressway is also nearby.

Please remember that you will be staying in a home, not a hotel. Therefore, we ask that you treat our space with the same respect you would show your own.

Guest entering this Agreement represents himself/herself as agent for all parties occupying the Unit during the period of occupancy by Guest. Guest booking this unit must be at least 25 years of age and will be responsible for all other persons occupying the Unit and/or any other person(s) from time to time present in the Unit, for compliance with this Agreement, listed policies, ordinances, rules and regulations, and for any losses incurred by Owner and/or Manager or to the Unit due to the activities of any such persons, whether intentional, negligent, or otherwise.

ADDITIONAL OCCUPANTS: This unit can accommodate a maximum of the number of 6 guests; provided, however, that the overnight occupants of the Unit will be limited to those persons listed as occupants in the reservation. Guest acknowledges and agrees that in the event that more than the agreed number of occupants spend the night at the Unit, or more than the agreed number occupants are at any given time inside the Unit, this Agreement will be immediately terminated, the Unit must be vacated and the entire amount of the Rental Fees and Security Deposit provided by Guest will be forfeited, in addition to any costs associated with legal remedies that may be necessary.

PARTIES AND NOISE: Quite hours must be respected (10PM-8AM.) Parties and/or events of any kind are strictly prohibited at the Unit. For the purposes of this Agreement, Owner and/or Manager will consider that there is a party inside the Unit whenever the number of daytime occupants in the Unit exceeds the number of guests outlined in the reservation. Notwithstanding the former provision, even if the number of guests is not exceeded, all other common definitions of a party will be accepted, whenever the noise level inside the Unit is beyond what is reasonably accepted as normal. Any violation of this rule will result in an immediate termination of the reservations and this Agreement will be immediately terminated, the Unit must be vacated and the entire amount of the Fees and Security Deposit will be forfeited, in addition to any costs associated with legal remedies that may be necessary. Guest agrees to keep the noise level inside the Unit under respectable levels, so as to not interfere with the peace and quiet of any person outside the boundaries of the Unit. Failure of Guest to adhere to this clause will be considered a breach of this Agreement. Any police enforcement actions will be at the sole risk and expense of the Guest.

A minimum charge of $250 will apply per reported incident.

PETS: Pets are not allowed in the property at anytime. If Guest brings a pet to the property, Guest risks forfeiting the Security Deposit.

Be very clear about your intentions when booking our home. There are to be absolutely no parties or outside guests other than those stated clearly in your reservation. Be very clear about the number of guests you are hosting in our property. If this rule is violated, we will have your entire reservation cancelled and your group removed from the property immediately without refund. Do not let this happen to you. We do not like surprises, and want to ensure all expectations are clear so everyone can enjoy their stay! By booking our property, you are agreeing to the contract below in its entirety:

Guest agrees to comply with all Terms and Conditions stated below, which are an essential part of this Agreement; Guest acknowledges he/she has read, understands, and is familiar with all Terms and Conditions.

Guest entering this Agreement represents himself/herself as agent for all parties occupying the Unit during the period of occupancy by Guest. Guest booking this unit must be at least 25 years of age and will be responsible for all other persons occupying the Unit and/or any other person(s) from time to time present in the Unit, for compliance with this Agreement, listed policies, ordinances, rules and regulations, and for any losses incurred by Owner and/or Manager or to the Unit due to the activities of any such persons, whether intentional, negligent, or otherwise.

ADDITIONAL OCCUPANTS: This unit can accommodate a maximum of the number of 6 guests; provided, however, that the overnight occupants of the Unit will be limited to those persons listed as occupants in the reservation. Guest acknowledges and agrees that in the event that more than the agreed number of occupants spend the night at the Unit, or more than the agreed number occupants are at any given time inside the Unit, this Agreement will be immediately terminated, the Unit must be vacated and the entire amount of the Rental Fees and Security Deposit provided by Guest will be forfeited, in addition to any costs associated with legal remedies that may be necessary.

PARTIES AND NOISE: Quite hours must be respected (10PM-8AM.) Parties and/or events of any kind are strictly prohibited at the Unit. For the purposes of this Agreement, Owner and/or Manager will consider that there is a party inside the Unit whenever the number of daytime occupants in the Unit exceeds the number of guests outlined in the reservation. Notwithstanding the former provision, even if the number of guests is not exceeded, all other common definitions of a party will be accepted, whenever the noise level inside the Unit is beyond what is reasonably accepted as normal. Any violation of this rule will result in an immediate termination of the reservations and this Agreement will be immediately terminated, the Unit must be vacated and the entire amount of the Fees and Security Deposit will be forfeited, in addition to any costs associated with legal remedies that may be necessary.

Upon request, during the summer months, you will have access to the patio between the building and the garage.

You can take one bus to all the train stations or Downtown within 15-20 minutes. Lyft and Uber are always in the area as well. 

My apartment is a beautiful place to relax. And being on the 3rd floor with a skylight gives you plenty of natural sun.

My 3rd floor apartment is the first place that I had on my own and I absolutely love staying there when I visit home. I currently live in Dallas but my family helps me host the place. 

It is a 3 bedroom, fully furnished with one queen bed and two full size beds that has a television with Netflix and Wi-fi. You will have an assortment of pots and pans in order to make yourself a home cooked meal along with all the essentials for your stay. Please bring your own toothbrush and toothpaste, though! :) 

When I got the place, I updated everything in the kitchen and bathroom to make a historic Chicago building feel brand new. There are stainless steel appliances and the stove is a cooktop with a granite countertop. 

The skylight is my favorite thing about my apartment and it allows plenty of natural sunlight to show off the  hardwood flooring and a relaxing setting with the trees that are right outside the 3 story building. 

The apartment is central to everything in the city. You can be in the suburbs within 20-25 minutes and the same goes for Downtown, Wrigley, United Center, Soldier Field and U.S Cellular Field.

The place will be yours at all times. I will help guide you through the city as needed or I will be as reserved as you need me to be. My family is always available to help out as well. Whatever you need, please do not hesitate to ask so that we can make your stay as enjoyable as possible.

The apartment lies within a gentrifying neighborhood in the city so you will have a mix of local Latin culture and up and coming professionals who are looking for a place to call their home. 

My favorite part of my place is that it is only two blocks away from the newly built 606 Trail and it is on the other side of a grocery store called Carnicerias Jimenez. They are open until 10pm with any food items that you might need and the best part is that you don't have to drive anywhere for a ""beer run."" It is only steps away from the apartment. 

There is a restaurant called ""La Casa del Tamal"" and they have extremely good reviews. Check them out, you will not be disappointed - my favorite is their Champurrado. If you love tacos and Mexican food, there are also a few selections and if you tell me which kind you are looking for, I can point you in the best direction. 

With a 24 hour Walgreens and a CVS three blocks away, you will have anything you need right at your fingertips. 

Being born and raised in the city, I love living in a busy intersection that gets traffic 24 hours a day. If you want the real city experience, this is the way to do it. Chicago is not a city for the light sleepers!

The CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) runs 24 hours on North Ave and you are in front of the bus stop. 

Route 72 (North Ave) takes you straight to North Ave beach on Lake Michigan or to the popular Bucktown nightlife. 

Route 72 also takes you directly to the Blue or Red Line train stations. 

The blue line goes to the airport and will also take you to Union Station downtown or many other Chicago landmarks.

The red line can take you Downtown, Wrigley field, Loyola University, U.S Cellular field or Chinatown.

One thing I would like to point out is that I DO NOT charge a cleaning fee the way other hosts do. I do this with the intention that my guests will leave the place tidy (within reason). I do not expect my guests to wash the sheets or scrub the floors, but please do not leave trash on the ground and if you spill anything, please wipe it down as you would your own home. Keep in mind that this is my HOME and not a hotel room. I hope you respect it as such. I worked very hard to get my place looking the way it does and I hope the Airbnb community can help me keep it that way.","As listed earlier, please treat the home as your own.

West Chesterfield is a small middle class, historically African-American neighborhood that values family, friends and their neighborhood. Though there are some fast food options nearby, most eating locations are driving distance. Restaurants that deliver can be found on Grub Hub and Uber Eats.

There is on-site parking available. We are also just one block from the 95th Street terminal, where the ""L"" train is located and where there is a bus hub. Greyhound buses also stop at this location. The Metra train station is about a mile away. The Red Line ""L"" will get you downtown and to other train lines, so you can connect to just about any other area in the city from there.

The building is on a busy street, which has its advantages and challenges. It is easy to get to the freeway or public transportation, but it is a busy location, with plenty of walking and street traffic on 95th street. There is a park across 95th street with a Chicago Park District Pool, and basketball courts as well as an open field and a jogging path. This is a predominantly African-American neighborhood, close to Chicago State University.","- After 10PM Please quiet down, be neighborly.

"1. You're living like a local, be respectful of the other locals. We mean, c'mon, how would you feel if your neighbor wasn't super awesome? 

2. All of our Rental Units are smoke-free environments. Even on the balcony, if you have one. We're super sorry if this is a bummer, but it's our policy. Hopefully we told you about it ahead of time and you aren't super surprised that we still mean it. 

3. Pets are super awesome, but they aren't allowed in our Rental Units. However, if your fur kiddo is a service animal then give us a call and we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your needs, as required by law.  

4. Your trip details should already be complete. If they aren't, give us a call ASAP so we can rectify that! What's a little information between friends?  

5. Your friend, your responsibility. Pretty simple, if you invite them to your Rental Unit, you're responsible for their actions.  

6. While watching a million people get out of a clown car is hilarious, there are occupancy rules Stay Alfred must follow for each of our buildings. Help us follow the rules and check your rental contract for occupancy requirements. If you exceed it, don't worry! Give us a call and we'll get you one of our bigger travel apartments. (It's like needing an Uber XL when you have a ton of people with you!) 

7. We're here to help! The onsite building staff doesn't work for Stay Alfred…strange, right? So, if you need something, send us a chat, or just give us a call. Our awesome Guest Services department will assist you 24/7.

8. Take only memories, leave only the keys, fobs, parking passes, etc. behind. They won't help you out when you get home and it's a total pain to have to replace them. 

9. We love gifts, but the greatest gift is making sure you don't leave anything behind. We suggest taking one last look around before you head home as fees are associated with sending you your belongings. Trust us, the extra five minutes is worth it! 

10. Ugh, here's the hard one. Should you break anything, really mess something up, or decide to stay longer than your agreed upon length of stay, we have the right to charge you additional fees, but we'd really rather not (and, we're sure you'd rather not too!)

NO SMOKING IN THE UNIT. $200 fine + cleaning fees.

Please take shoes off in unit. It's a Japanese thing and it keeps the unit cleaner. Thank you.

Please wash your dishes. There will be a $25 fee for anything more than a handful of dishes left behind.

Please BE HONEST about extra guests (first 3 guests are included in price). The extra guest fee will be doubled if you are deceptive. There are cameras on the exterior of the building.

Absolutely NO parties. Guests will be immediately evicted without refund. IF YOU ARE TRYING TO BE SLICK AND THROW A PARTY AND/OR THEN TRY TO CANCEL: I WILL KEEP WHATEVER MONEY YOU PAY PER THE CANCELLATION POLICY. 

I want to preface the following by saying 95% of our guests leave our places in amazing condition. We are very understanding about small messes that may have been overlooked as I know I am by no means perfect. That being said the following is to address the 5% who may not understand quite how airbnb works yet. 
1. We are not a hotel. 
2. We are not your personal maids. 

While there is a cleaning fee, the fee is to cover changing of linens, washing of towels and ""normal"" cleaning of the kitchen, bathroom and living areas. What is not covered and WILL incur an extra fee are the following: 

1. A pile of dishes left in the sink (violates house rules)
2. Excessive kitchen messes such as cooking grease all over the stove.
3. Excessive food on the floors (I dont mean a few crumbs-I mean it looked like someone was feeding pigeons).
4. Chewing gum ground into the furniture (yes, that has actually happened).
5. OBVIOUS wearing of shoes in the unit (we are a no-shoes house- see house rules) ie shoes foot prints, tracked in dirt and mud.
5. Anything else above and beyond what is considered ""normal"" cleaning. 
6. smoking in the unit will AUTOMATICALLY  incur a $200 fee. 

Again- this ISNT the majority of our guests and we understand things can be overlooked. Upon an ""excessive cleaning"" situation, I will not leave any review, I will simply send a request for an extra cleaning fee (usually around $25-50) depending on how much extra time it took to clean. Thank you for your understanding.

The entirety of the home is yours to enjoy. For those warmer, Chicago months, there is a communal backyard patio area that is accessible and shared by all.

Buena Park is a tree-lined neighborhood bordering Lake Michigan and Lake Shore Drive. There is a walking/biking path that runs along the lake and will take you directly downtown or up north towards Evanston.  There are several grocery and convenient stores in the area, ie: Whole Foods, Go Grocer, Jewel & Osco and Walgreens, all within walking distance.  It is a peaceful reprieve from the city center but close enough to enjoy all the city has to offer.

Our property is conveniently located next to several bus lines located just at the end of both Gordon Terrace street (at Marine Drive and Clarendon Ave) that takes you directly into the loop. Both bus 135, 136 are available.  The Red Line is located a few blocks away at Sheridan and Irving Park road. If you plan on having a car,  we are just off of Lake Shore Drive, which takes you into the loop. Street parking does not require a permit on Gordon Terrace or there is valet, heated, indoor parking next door at 720 W. Gordon Terrace for a daily rate of $14.

Check-In: Our building does not allow for lockboxes. To bypass this issue, we will have your keys stored in the mailbox labeled, Frigelis. The key to the mailbox will be placed under the upper right-hand corner of the rug mat in the entrance vestibule. The keys located inside of the mailbox will be for the duration of your stay. The largest of the keys will be to access the main points, ie: downstairs doors, both front and back. The other key will be for the unit. Our unit is located on the second floor and has a green wreath. To unlock, only unlock the bottom lock and turn to the right. If you have any trouble, please make sure to pull the door towards you in order to open. 

Departure: We typically request a check out time of 11 am. If you need flexibility with this time, please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate your request. Please leave your set(s) of keys in the silver bowl on the entrance table in the foyer.",,,"Buena Park is a tree-lined neighborhood bordering Lake Michigan and Lake Shore Drive.

Lakeview

Why we love it
Lakeview’s laidback atmosphere and picture-perfect shoreline make it a favorite hang out among locals. And spots like lively Wrigleyville and the Belmont Theater District make it a major entertainment hub, too.

Insider tips
Anchored by a beautiful stretch of shoreline to the east, Lakeview melds several distinct areas — East Lakeview, Central Lakeview, Boystown, and Wrigleyville. Each spot has its own unique character, but they’re all pulled together by Lakeview’s casual, welcoming feel.

Hit the bustling shopping districts along Broadway in East Lakeview, along Belmont near Boystown, and the bustling Southport Corridor for local boutiques, record shops, and vintage treasure hunting. Or live it up with the locals at the seemingly endless array of bars and pubs, and the dozens of much-loved neighborhood restaurants that lie in between.

Lakeview is also known as a go-to for arts and culture — you’ll find live music venues, summer street festivals, and a thriving theatre, dance, and comedy scene. Blue Man Group is a world-famous troupe that brings music, comedy, and performance art together in one unforgettable show (if you’re sitting in the “Splash Zone”, you’ll want to put on that waterproof poncho).

On a nice day, walk east until you hit Lake Michigan. That’s where you’ll find a 1,200-acre outdoor oasis, featuring the scenic Lakefront Trail, a golf course and driving range, a boat harbor, tennis courts, and grassy fields perfect for picnicking.

Explore like a local
Grab a cup of award-winning coffee, and maybe splurge on a custom-made cruiser, at Heritage Bicycles. Enjoy craft beer, a live organist, and vintage surroundings at the Music Box Theatre. Visit the museum-like showroom at Chicago Music Exchange for a tour of one of the world’s premier vintage guitar collections.",,,"Lakeview

Less than a mile to Wrigley Field, a two minute walk to the subway, and a few blocks from all the great restaurants in both Roscoe Village and the Southport Corridor. This newly renovated 1-bedroom garden apartment features a brand new kitchen & bathroom. The perfect retreat for a weekend visit or longer stay!

The unit features one queen bed, and an air mattress can be provided upon request.

We (Lee & Laura) live in the upstairs house with our friendly 40 pound dog named Ruby!

As we are on-site, we are available to provide any assistance you may need, including recommendations on places to see and eat!

Roscoe Village is home to some amazing places and events. Local favorites include: Dinkel's (bakery), Paulina Meat Market, and Le Sud (Restaurant) to name just a few. There are a number of festivals nearby during warmer months too!

Roscoe Street features an abundance of restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and shopping.

Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, and Target are a short walk away.

The Brown line train stop at Paulina St is a 2-3 minute walk. It can take you straight into downtown Chicago! If you don't want to take public transportation, it is very easy to get an Uber or Lyft from here. 

If you are driving, we are about a 10-minute drive from the Addison Street exit off 90/94. There is plenty of street parking near the house (that's what we use). 

We are also 1.5 miles from DePaul University!",,"As we are on-site, we are available to provide any assistance you may need, including recommendations on places to see and eat!","Roscoe Village is home to some amazing places and events.

We are a monthly stay company only and thus we do not apply a monthly discount on our Airbnb listings: our ""nightly"" rate already reflects the pricing for 30 days or more.  Any further discounts to our listed rate need to be approved by owners, and factors that they value include but aren't limited to:
-potential stays longer than 3 months
-potential guests with 2 or more positive Airbnb reviews
-detailed inquiries that demonstrate that you have reviewed the entire listing's descriptions and that help us feel that you would be a good fit for the space.  Happy to answer clarifying questions of course, but we invest a considerable amount of time to make sure our listings are thorough, accurate, and current, and appreciate those potential guests who take the time to review the listing in its entirety.
-potential guests who demonstrate that they have read through the entire listing and mention the color yellow anywhere within their first message to us 
-reservations that begin soon after the previous guest's departure (view listing calendar)
-reservations that end close to the subsequent guest's arrival (view listing calendar)


We aim to be competitive and fair with our pricing.  To that end, if you request a discount, providing links to other Airbnb listings you are considering for a ""price match"" type of process can also potentially increase the owners' willingness to offer a discount.","- Quiet hours between 10pm and 8am, 7 days a week.

-- It is the guest's responsibility to plan for Airbnb's planned monthly charges for the 2nd month and beyond.  If there is an issue with the first scheduled Airbnb auto-charge (typically occurs 28-30 days after check-in date) and it is not resolved within 24 hours of Airbnb sending an email that there was an issue with the payment, an automatic $200 penalty is assessed.  Any issues with autocharges after the 2nd month that aren't resolved within 24 hours are subject to a $100 penalty if not resolved within 24 hours of Airbnb sending the notification.","Prior to booking, an in-person viewing may be possibly arranged only if there is not a current resident living in the property - please check the listing's calendar on your proposed viewing date to confirm that it might be possible. Should you book the property, please note that you will be the beneficiary of this policy as well, and we will never inconvenience you with showing requests during your stay. Viewing all the pictures, descriptions, and reviews of this listing as well as others in the area is a great way to familiarize yourself with the property, location, and living experience.

Permission to enter – unless you request otherwise, please note that if any repair/fix is discovered and needs to be addressed, we will provide 24 hours notice that someone on our staff will be entering the unit address it.  We will do our best to provide an accurate timeframe in these circumstances.","Bridgeport is the quintessential Chicago neighborhood.

We are a monthly stay company only and thus we do not apply a monthly discount on our Airbnb listings: our ""nightly"" rate already reflects the pricing for 30 days or more.  Any further discounts to our listed rate need to be approved by owners, and factors that they value include but aren't limited to:
-potential stays longer than 3 months
-potential guests with 2 or more positive Airbnb reviews
-detailed inquiries that demonstrate that you have reviewed the entire listing's descriptions and that help us feel that you would be a good fit for the space.  Happy to answer clarifying questions of course, but we invest a considerable amount of time to make sure our listings are thorough, accurate, and current, and appreciate those potential guests who take the time to review the listing in its entirety.
-potential guests who demonstrate that they have read through the entire listing and mention the color yellow anywhere within their first message to us 
-reservations that begin soon after the previous guest's departure (view listing calendar)
-reservations that end close to the subsequent guest's arrival (view listing calendar)


We aim to be competitive and fair with our pricing.  To that end, if you request a discount, providing links to other Airbnb listings you are considering for a ""price match"" type of process can also potentially increase the owners' willingness to offer a discount.","-Onsite indoor garage potentially available - please confirm availability prior to booking if you require this (as there are more apartments than there are garage spaces).  If unavailable, there is free unmetered street parking that is generally very available directly outside the building

The history of Irving Park and Logan Square is probably the first thing that stands out to me. Noted by many for its historic homes, I love strolling the streets of Irving Park/Logan Square to admire its architecture. As a lover of bungalow-style houses and all things historic, I have a soft spot for Irving Park.  The area also has loads of transportation, which makes it easy to come here for the day or commute in/out if you make this your home.

I love the peaceful tree lined streets, and also the easy access to every restaurant and bar in Chicago.  Great access to Wrigley Field and all that Chicago has to offer!

Check out the Kilbourn Park Organic Greenhouse! The first-ever public fruit tree orchard in a major metropolitan city was planted in Kilbourn Park at the Greenhouse in fall 2008!  It is a wonderful resource for the community and visitors alike.

House rules are mainly related to noise levels at late hours / disturbing other tenants in the building, or neighbors to the East and West.  If you intend to use the unit for loud partying all day and night, then this is not the space for you.",,"I am available to help with details of your stay in Chicago, or stay out of your way!

There is also a deck in the rear of the building that comes off the second floor attached to Peter and Kristin’s place; you are more than welcome to hang out on the deck which has tables and chairs. 

Although Peter and Kristin live above the apartment, The Drake is completely separate and private; you'll be able to enjoy as much privacy as you wish. Total transparency note: the laundry washer and dryer and located in a shared utility room accessed from the back door of the unit; however, these machines are exclusively for your use as the upstairs unit has its own.","Located in Chicago's Irving Park neighborhood, our brand new, full-time AirBnB space, The Drake, is in a perfect spot to home-base your work or play visit. Close to Wrigley Field, the ''EL"" Blue Line, I-90, and the airport, you'll find our spot to be cozy, comfortable, and convenient!

The Drake is in the historic Irving Park neighborhood with an off-street parking spot, if needed, and additional parking passes for the street if you have multiple cars. The Drake is smaller but super cozy as you can see from the pix, around 900 square feet, with two bedrooms, an eat-in kitchen, a bathroom, and a separate laundry area. The sofa converts into a full-size bed that can sleep a fifth person. The Drake has terrific light and somehow manages to always be the perfect temperature no matter what the season. We’ve added a large, flat screen TV with an Amazon Fire Stick loaded with apps to use and, of course, WiFI is provided. The Drake is a garden unit that is three steps below street level.

Becky and David, the owners, live in rural Illinois about 70 miles from The Drake. But The Drake is still our home: we first lived here together, were married while living here, and adopted many four-legged children here. Our friend, Peter, lives in the unit upstairs and has since we moved to our current home in 2012; Peter’s roommate, Kristin, has also lived at The Drake for several years. Peter is our onsite AirBnB Manager, and is a Chicago fireman and paramedic, so you can feel confident that The Drake is well managed and safe.

The Irving Park neighborhood is truly one of the best to get a real feel for life in Chicago: older but gentrifying, tree-lined streets lined with homes with families of all ages, and minutes from other amazing neighborhoods.

One of the best things about The Drake, is its location in a great neighborhood with easy access to the rest of the city. The Drake is located 1/2 block north of Irving Park Road; hop on the Irving Park 80 bus and head three miles east to Wrigley field. Or, if you are interested in using the EL / subway like a true Chicagoan, the Blue Line, which travels between O'Hare airport and the Loop downtown, is less than a 3/4 mile walk. If you are driving, you're likely using the main artery in and out of downtown, or to O'Hare, which is I-90 known as the Kennedy Expressway in Chicago; the Kennedy on ramp is a four minute drive from The Drake.

If you have any physical limitations, you may want to consider the following:

*The apartment is a garden unit three steps down from street level.

*The bathtub shower is a step over a short wall into the tub.

If this is your first time with Airbnb, welcome, but please familiarize yourself with the concept - this is our home and NOT a hotel. 

We truly welcome all walks of life and believe on being inclusive; everyone is welcome to our home irrespective of orientation, background, origin, or other factors that make us unique. The only exception is that if you are looking for a party palace, this is not the location for you; we don't want any drugs or other illegal activities going on in our home - this is a family area.

Other notes to be transparent:
Our base rate is for two people, each additional person beyond the first two people is an additional $10 per person per night. While the unit sleeps five, that will get a little snug.

We have plans to rebuild the front entrance to The Drake; the construction around the front door, and the front door itself, leave a little to be desired so next spring/summer we plan to: rebuild the walls and overhang around the entrance, replace the front entrance, and add a keyless entry lock to The Drake.

We are continuing to add amenities to The Drake; if anything is missing that we stated, if anything is not working, if anything was not appropriately stocked or cleaned to your satisfaction on arrival, PLEASE let us know urgently so that we can rectify this. We have AirBnB SuperHost status and the only way for us to maintain that is to ensure we provide the experience that we promise.","Please do not wear shoes in the house.

We are usually in and out due to our crazy schedules. The best way to reach us is by messaging us. We will respond ASAP!

This neighborhood has a cozy, suburban  feel with neighbors walking their dogs, mowing their lawns, and hanging out at the local park nearby. 

There is a Walgreens, 7-11, Jewel, Rosati’s, McDonald’s, and a local fast food joint called Booby’s within walking distance. 

If you drive 10-15 minutes North or South, you pretty much have access to anything you want!

Uber and lyft are readily available. The bus stop is also close by

Please note again that there are kids upstairs who run around and play like kids do. The tenants are told to keep their kids quiet after 10 pm. 

Also, we currently have renovations and projects going on throughout the unit. Most of it is done so we won’t be working too much while you are here. We will do our best not to disturb you.

Lastly, we have a puppy in the unit. We keep in our room but she may bark when she hears you walking around. We will do our best to keep her quiet.

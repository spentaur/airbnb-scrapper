Short walk to Fullerton or Armitage buses, just under 20 minutes walk to Blue Line el train station, also 10 minutes to nearest Metra train to downtown.
FANTASTIC bars and restaurants in neighborhood (good options within walking distance), and shopping/sites. Accessible to other parts of the city.
Chicago resident for over 10 years, so happy to provide guidance on this awesome city!

Clean and modern design, with some exotic flair from items picked up from world travels. The space for guests has standard comforts to make stay easier: shelves, hanging rack, desk & chair in guest bedroom with full size bed, and master bedroom includes a hanging rack and dresser space, ensuite master bath, and queen size bed. Both bathrooms include towels and toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hand soap, cotton balls/swabs). Bedrooms have locks for privacy. 
The living room sofa converts into a full-size bed and extra bedding is kept inside the chaise section of the sofa. There is a TV with options for watching movies and shows, and a dvd player and a Redbox dvd kiosk a few blocks away in front of Tony's grocery store. (There is an infrared sauna in the living room that can only be used with permission/release and instruction.)
The kitchen is stocked with standard amenities: stove, microwave, fridge, dishwasher, coffee maker (Ninja with latte options and French press), tea kettle, pots/pans, dishes, and free tea in the white canisters. 
Washer and dryer in unit with laundry detergent provided.
Condo equipped with high speed internet, and although I don't have cable, I have a Roku with access to Netflix, Hulu, Roku channel (and other stations). 
Grocery store within a few blocks, restaurants and bars also within walking distance, and main logan square intersection about 20 minutes walk. Farmers market there every Sunday in season as well as lots of restaurants/bars/shops/movie theater.
Comfortable, clean, cozy space in great neighborhood!

I am very friendly and social, and happy to provide recommendations and even take you out to some of my favorite spots if I'm available. Feel free to email or text with any concerns during your stay as I also live in Logan Square.

Logan Square is my favorite neighborhood in Chicago. There are so many great restaurants, including the Michelin starred restaurant Longman & Eagle, among other great dining spots, and some of the best bars in the city like Scofflaw, Best Intentions, The Whistler, Lost Lake, Revolution Brewing, etc. There is also a very popular bar a couple blocks away with huge outdoor area with bags called Park & Field that is great during nice weather. There are fun shops from resale to upscale, books stores, comic book store, arcade, movie theater all within walking distance or short drive. There's a hipster vibe but it's a diverse neighborhood. Logan Square named one of the nation's coolest neighborhoods in 2016! It's also next to fantastic and popular neighborhoods of Bucktown/Wicker Park/Humboldt Park with restaurants/shopping/parks, and easily accessible to other parts of the city.

Uber and Lyfts are plentiful, two bus stops are very close (Fullerton is a few blocks, Armitage is within 10 minutes walk), and the el train is an easy walk (15-20 minutes). There is also a Metra station 15 minutes walk north that goes downtown. There is free street parking on my street and on nearby streets, though some streets nearby require permits so check when parking. The 606 walk/bike elevated path is also very close. There are Divvy bike stations (shared bikes) to use all over the neighborhood/city including one a few blocks walk from the condo.

There is easy access to outdoor areas, including a small community park only two houses down on my corner, so please keep smoking to outside the apartment. No smoking inside. Preference is to also leave shoes by the welcome mat and not wear them inside. Please also keep noise to a minimum to be respectful of others in the building. No parties (only guests) inside condo please. Thank you!",,"I am very friendly and social, and happy to provide recommendations and even take you out to some of my favorite spots if I'm available.

Located in the Oakton Historic District, the neighborhood boasts of older homes, multi-dwelling housing, two parks, and an elementary school. The neighbors are friendly, and take great pride with maintaining their homes and yards. Enjoy a walk around the neighborhood, you will meet friendly neighbors, and you'll discover some hidden beauty in architecture, some sustainable initiatives such as perennial gardens with lots of pollinator plants, composting, and a bee-keeper.

There are two parks in close proximity to my front door.  Walk north about a block and you will discover  a basketball court, baseball diamond, and an open field for soccer.  For families with young children, just one block east is an open space with a playscape.

My home is about a 12 minute walk from the South Blvd Purple Line,  (EL) train, and a 20 minute walk from Evanston's Main St. Metra.  Presence St. Francis Hospital is a 7 minute walk from my front door. My residence is a five minute drive south of Northwestern.

You may have noticed that my unique floor-plan design provides ample space for privacy. However, there is one main space shared in common, that's the bathroom.

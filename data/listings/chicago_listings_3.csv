I am at the location for most of the  bookings, the bedroom is private with a lockable door,i sleep in living room on sofa bed when I am  there. So the space is open,not private.

These synonymous neighborhoods are famous for live music and nightlife, chef-driven restaurants and countless art galleries — many housed within the Flat Iron Arts Building.

Privacy Statement on the Use of Security Cameras:
We respect and value the privacy of our guests. We will never place a camera inside a living space. While Airbnb policy allows cameras in spaces that are not used for sleeping or bathing, we disagree. Cameras should be banned from inside all living spaces. Footage should be automatically deleted. Everything should be disclosed in advance. We use hallway security cameras to verify the number of guests who have entered an apartment. This is useful for stopping parties, and under additional prices extra guest charges may apply for extra people sleeping over. We use a camera on the balcony to monitor for smoking. This area is publicly visible from the street. All footage is deleted automatically after a stay, unless there is an open resolution center case. It’s unfortunate that not every guest is honest about their intentions, and our community would not allow us to be on Airbnb if we did not prevent unwanted behaviors.

PARKING
ONE outdoor parking space is included with this rental. The space is yours from 12PM the day of check-in until 11AM the day of check-out, but not before or after. We will provide you with the space number. We have recommendations for paid parking if you need additional spaces. XL vehicles like Ford Expedition or F-450 will not fit in these 96"" wide spaces. If you go over the line, you'll be towed.
----------
CHECK-IN TIME 
Typically, guests may receive the keys and drop their bags in the apartment as early as 12PM (noon). The cleaners do need until 4PM to do their work, and the apartment may be dirty anytime until 4.  
If you'd like to drop your bags early and head out until the cleaners finish, we can usually accommodate you! If you'd like to take a nap or shower right away, and the night before your stay isn't booked yet, let's discuss booking that night before! Then you could arrive as early as you'd like that day! 
----------
CHECK-OUT TIME
11AM is check-out. If you'll need a check-out after 11AM, and the night after your stay isn't booked yet, let's chat about booking that next night! Then you could leave as late as you'd like that day!
We *do* have a luggage locker a block away!
----------
OCCUPANCY 
Upon booking, your reservation will have paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number whether visiting or sleeping,  you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first. 
We consider the maximum capacity of the apartment to be its sleeping capacity - eight individuals. Anyone past eight would not be permitted. 
Enjoy the city! Please don’t bring a party back.
----------
RATES
Rates and minimum stays change constantly - every night is different! 
The nightly rate changes based on number of guests, which is verified upon arrival. Please do your best to let me know how many guests will be staying in advance!
----------
The pictures you see have accurate furniture, finishes, square footage - really everything! The art and positioning of items *might* be slightly different. Please don’t be concerned! Read the reviews! I assure you that the photos accurately represent what you will receive!

The entire apartment is yours during your stay!

WICKER PARK! 
The apartment is located in the center of Chicago's hipster haven! This awesome neighborhood has so many bars, restaurants, independent coffee joints and quirky shops you'll have no idea where to start - until you check out our curated guidebook! We'll give you a taste for starters.

CHEESIES, a casual bar up Milwaukee Avenue, has killer grilled cheese. The Popper is the best choice on the menu. We've only been after a few drinks, but we see people there all day. Good sign. 
EMPORIUM ARCADE BAR WICKER PARK is great for games and drinks. The cocktails are a little pricey, but you can play pinball for hours.  
PIECE PIZZA AND BREWERY has the best New Haven style pizza outside of Connecticut, and even better, it's not from New York! Their Hefeweizen is top notch, and they have live music all the time.
And at PODHALANKA you'll experience a Polish grandmother's welcome by stuffing you with blintzes, pierogies, and roast beef - and not taking 'please, no more' for an answer. 

We’ve got tips about hidden speakeasy’s and burlesque shows, coffee shops and grab-and-go breakfast, high-end can't miss dinners, quick meals, late nights and boozy brunch, plus extensive day trips all throughout the city. We put our heart into it, and you’ll find advice on other can’t-miss places worth a train or Uber ride, including FIVE distinct nightlife districts throughout the city!

There's no need for a car here!

PARKING
ONE outdoor parking space is included with this rental. The space is yours from 12PM the day of check-in until 11AM the day of check-out, but not before or after. We will provide you with the space number. We have recommendations for paid parking if you need additional spaces. XL vehicles like Ford Expedition or F-450 will not fit in these 96"" wide spaces. If you go over the line, you'll be towed.
----------
CHECK-IN TIME 
Typically, guests may receive the keys and drop their bags in the apartment as early as 12PM (noon). The cleaners do need until 4PM to do their work, and the apartment may be dirty anytime until 4.  
If you'd like to drop your bags early and head out until the cleaners finish, we can usually accommodate you! If you'd like to take a nap or shower right away, and the night before your stay isn't booked yet, let's discuss booking that night before! Then you could arrive as early as you'd like that day! 
----------
CHECK-OUT TIME
11AM is check-out. If you'll need a check-out after 11AM, and the night after your stay isn't booked yet, let's chat about booking that next night! Then you could leave as late as you'd like that day!
We *do* have a luggage locker a block away!
----------
OCCUPANCY 
Upon booking, your reservation will have paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number whether visiting or sleeping,  you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first. 
We consider the maximum capacity of the apartment to be its sleeping capacity - eight individuals. Anyone past eight would not be permitted. 
Enjoy the city! Please don’t bring a party back.
----------
RATES
Rates and minimum stays change constantly - every night is different! 
The nightly rate changes based on number of guests, which is verified upon arrival. Please do your best to let me know how many guests will be staying in advance!
----------
The pictures you see have accurate furniture, finishes, square footage - really everything! The art and positioning of items *might* be slightly different. Please don’t be concerned!

I live nearby and can generally provide in person help when needed.  Pretty much always available by phone.

nights at 20% off OR 30+ at 25% off! 

The best of both worlds! Recently renovated two-story condo in Old Town with all modern amenities,  in a classic 19th century Chicago home in one of the oldest parts of the city. Ideal for traveling families and friends, and plenty of Chicago culture nearby, from nearly every era. A neighborhood bar with Frank Sinatra's favorite ribs! Michelin-starred restaurants! And only 20 minutes to the Loop on the train - book today!

When you enter - via private entrance - you walk up a set of stairs into an open living room / dining room / kitchen with soaring ceilings. Down a hallway are two bedrooms: one with a King-sized bed and an en-suite bathroom, and one with a Queen-sized bed. There's another full bathroom along the hallway as well, and the washer and dryer. Up a set of stairs from the living room is an additional bedroom with a Twin-sized bed. The couch in the living room functions as another Twin-sized bed.

You'll have full access to my entire two-story condo.

An incredibly popular neighborhood destination, largely because of its close proximity to the lake and downtown, Old Town keeps up a lively pace day and night. Victorian-era buildings, brick alleyways and narrow, tree-lined streets are charming backdrops to a busy main strip that runs along Wells Street between North Avenue and Division Street.

I'm a 5 minute walk to the Sedgwick Brown line stop, and just as close to the North Ave and Halsted bus lines - it's easy to get around town without a car from here! There's street parking in the neighborhood if you'll have a car with you, however.

The Near West Side , one of the 77 community areas of Chicago, is on the West Side, west of the Chicago River and adjacent to the Loop and West Loop. The history of the Near West Side of Chicago includes the founding of Hull House, a prominent settlement house. The Great Chicago Fire started in the Near West Side. The area is home to the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), the United Center and the Illinois Medical not a very walkable neighborhood, but bigger streets such as Madison and Western are more interesting to walk through but only after 1 mile you will hit the posh neighborhoods. Listing is on Western and Madison intersection.

My listings are very close to public transportation. The bus stop is right on the intersection and my house is 5th from a major intersection with 2 buses.  The way chicago works is that each bus goes in a straight line. Madison bus goes to downtown, loop, Sears (Willis) tower and Millennium Park, and Western bus goes to different neighborhoods such as Bucktown and Wicker Park and Medical District.  Blue line is about 8 minute walk, and also goes to downtown, loop and the airport.  Also if you get Uber and use UberPool, its only about $2.50-3$ to get around which is not that much different sometimes from public transportation prices ($2.25).","Please do not wear shoes in the house.

The layout allows for a lot of privacy as your rooms and bathroom are located in the basement area of my home. I work from home and occupy the upstairs. I operate an Organic Catering Company called ""Goose & Fox"", as well as a recording studio. The building itself is over 100 years old and located in awesome part of town.

You have the privacy of your own bathroom & bedroom, as well as an office with an extra futon and an extra bed.

I try to give my guests as much space as I think they want or need. 

If I am around, I am accessible but not in your space, meaning I am working in my office with the door slightly cracked or doing something upstairs while you are downstairs in your bedroom or bathroom. I also operate a recording studio so sometimes I am upstairs recording stuff. I also have two friendly dogs who generally hang with me in the office. They sometimes bark when people arrive but are super friendly after a couple minutes. They do not have access to the basement. 

On the other hand, if you need answers or just want to talk, I always enjoy this part of the host experience.

I try to let the guest set the pace when it comes to how much interaction we have.

The place is located in the heart of Historic Lincoln Park with easy access to the Armitage Brown Line stop and the ""el"".  We are in the best possible location if you need access to downtown we are literally a 5-10 minute train ride away.

Lincoln Park is home to DePaul University and boasts tree-lined lakefront paths for biking/jogging, a vibrant shopping district, beach, dozens of ethnically diverse restaurants, live music venues, movie theaters and more. north avenue beach, and the lakefront, are less than 10 minutes from our home.

Breakfast is offered at an additional charge with your stay but you must verify the time  you want prior to your arrival or the day before when you arrive. Breakfast can be served at any time and is cooked to order so you can sleep in if you need to, but you must arrange it with the host so we can make sure we have everything we need to give you a great breakfast. 

-free coffee/tea during your entire stay 
-full cooked to order breakfast (omelettes, frittattas, potatoes, french toast, pancakes, locally sourced bacon, biscuits & gravy, eggs benedict. special dietary needs are no problem! Your Host is a world class Chef so we can pretty much make anything and it will always be awesome!

I DO NOT PROVIDE PARKING. STOP ASKING ME ABOUT PARKING. WE ARE LOCATED IN A LARGE CITY. PARKING IS DIFFICULT. Public transit is a much better option.

Buses and trains are literally ride outside my front door and about a minute walk from the apartment (train ride downtown is then only a 10 minute ride)

Cabs: No more than a moments wait to flag a cab directly out front of my place day and night. This is a safe area where you can walk around at night as well.

Parking: We are about 5 minutes from downtown so Parking is limited, random and mostly based on luck like any populated urban area. research the neighborhood and plan ahead. I do not provide parking and due to the popularity of the area my recommendations will only go so far. Our location is great for public transit, which we recommend you use.

Hostels provide budget-oriented, sociable accommodation where guests can rent a bed, usually a bunk bed, in a dormitory and share a bathroom, lounge and sometimes a kitchen. 

There are several differences between hostels and hotels, including:
Hostels tend to be budget-oriented; rates are considerably lower.
For those who prefer an informal environment, hostels do not usually have the same level of formality as hotels.
For those who prefer to socialize with their fellow guests, hostels usually have more common areas and opportunities to socialize. The dormitory aspect of hostels also increases the social factor.
Hostels are generally self-catering.

PLEASE DO NOT 
- Do anything illegal 
- Smoke inside (Thank You) 
- Invite guests over without prior written approval 
-ask me about parking (do the research, google directions)


Valid IDs will be required upon checking in. 
I can be very flexible with move in and move out times as long as I can get the apartment cleaned for the next airbnb client

DISCLAIMER! 
Now that I have hosted for over a year, I generally prefer more laid back guests who have experience with airbnb. Specifically, Millenials, Artistic types and younger folks going to concerts, work trips etc. This space is not exactly the four seasons but I do my best to make it comfy and affordable. If you are an older more discerning traveler who is going to not follow the rules, read my ad or at least  send me some basic info on the why, when and where when you attempt to book it probably be best for you to stay at a hotel. I also tend to only book people who have experience with home sharing, as new guests tend to not follow the simple requests and like to write 5 paragraph essays on the stain they found on the bathtub.","Please just be Respectful of the House and be Housebroken!

Our 2 unit building is on a quiet tree-lined street, away from the rowdiness and noise of the party streets but still affords you walking access to a huge variety of exceptional restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, entertainment, and an 11 minute walk to Wrigley Field. Our apartment is a great home base to get around the whole city and also relax away from the crowds. Parking permits provided.

We have been part of the Lakeview fabric for over 30 years. We bought our 1890's house over 20 years ago and rehabbed it then. The apartment has 10 foot ceilings and is duplexed down (2 floors) into the garden level where the 2nd and 3rd bedrooms are located. If you played college basketball, you may have to duck your head a bit downstairs. 

Our street is very quiet and neighborly, (many on the street raised their kids here - including us), but close enough to walk to the areas that makes our neighborhood so vibrant. 

Access to the Southport stop on the Brown line ""L"" is 3 minutes by foot, which will get you to the apartment or all over the city; but why go anywhere else, Lakeview/Southport Corridor has it all. :)

Our in home  “Welcome Book” will give you many recommendations for the neighborhood (restaurants, bars, activities, shopping, theater etc). We are Airbnb'ers too, so we have met many different hosts. Our style is fluid; if you need anything or recommendations, we can help. If you are here to chill, that is alright with us too. We are here to give you the support you prefer!

Lakeview/Southport Corridor (the second largest neighborhood in the city) has it all and was voted the #3 big city neighborhood to live, IN THE COUNTRY! by MONEY MAGAZINE. Lakeview encircles the sub neighborhoods of East Lakeview, Central Lakeview, Southport Corridor, Boystown and Wrigleyville — parts of a sum that celebrates diversity, neighborhood living, along with something special for all visitors.

Make sure to hit all the Lakeview commercial streets:
•Belmont Avenue
•Lincoln Avenue
•Southport Avenue
•Halsted Street
•Broadway Avenue 

Here you will find, many locally owned shops/boutiques with clothing from funky vintage to time tested preppy (try to support the local businesses). Additionally the bars/taverns/pubs and dives are certainly places you can’t miss. We have an incredible micro brew scene (Chicago has 83 brewers), and bars of varying pedigree (sports, college designated, dive, music, gay, local watering holes etc) giving you unlimited choices.

We are one block off of Southport Ave which has exceptional food choices from fast casual to fine dining. We are sure you can find something in your wheel-house. Additionally, our bars run from young to sophisticated with everything in between. Southport Lanes right around the corner from the apartment even has a 3 lane bowling alleys with pins that are hand set.

Theater is alive and well in the neighborhood along with comedy, dance and small club music venues - visit the clubs that the major acts played when no one knew them along with some of the new bands on their way up. All within walking distance.  

Our in home  “Welcome Book” will give you many recommendations for the neighborhood.

If you don't need a car, don't bring one, Chicago is built for easy travel and our home is situated perfectly from O'Hare and Midway - your walk from the ""L"" or a CTA bus is only 3 blocks to the apartment. 

From the apartment, you have several close transit options:
Brown, Red, and Purple ""L"" Trains,
CTA Buses,
Divvy bike share rack is 2 blocks away,
Lyft, Uber and Taxi are abundant,
The best way - by foot

Lakeview is activity oriented and kid-friendly. Run or bike the lakeshore, play beach volleyball, kayak the river, grab a city shared-bike and explore the 606 trail and different neighborhoods. Take the ""L"" down to our world class museums or an architectural tour on the Chicago River. 

We have many kid friendly parks with the newest located 1 block away, which was paid for by the neighborhood families and the Cubs - it is awesome!

Parking is available on the streets, but is restricted to permits from 6p-6a and Cub games. We can help you with this.

Additionally, parking garages are nearby and parking services apps such as Spothero and ParkWhiz are very helpful and reasonable.","- All bookings require a security deposit of $700 or more. You will not be charged for this in advance.

Logan Square is consistently ranked one of the Top 25 hottest neighborhoods in the country. We have included some of our favorite spots on the site as well. Cubs fans you are only five miles from Wrigley Field. Park and Uber/Lyft to the game.

The strong neighborly connection is evident all around-community gardens and a locally-run farmers market. ""Local"" being the key word when describing many aspects of the scene: ingredients are sourced locally at their buzz-worthy restaurants; corner taps tout local, craft brews; galleries showcase local artists; and concerts and street fests promote local, upstart bands.

At the heart of this community is the actual ""square"" in Logan Square.  The boulevards themselves are widened thoroughfares that are set apart by grassy, landscaped medians and tall, stately trees that border both its sides. The neighborhood boasts four of them in total and these link together to form Chicago's ""Emerald Necklace,"" an expansive system of interconnected parks and streetscapes dotted with beautifully-restored mansions, handsome greystone homes and majestic churches.

Location: The home is located on a quiet tree-lined street. You are within walking distance to public transportation or a short drive via Uber/Lyft/personal vehicle away form all that the Logan Square neighborhood has to offer. The actual ""square"" and center of the neighborhood is approximately a 10-15 minute walk from the home, or 1-2 minute car ride away. The best way to get to the square is walking through the neighborhood and enjoying the historic Logan Square architecture.

If separate sleeping spaces are needed let us know and we can provide an additional air bed as well.

Each guest is different and prefers a different amount of socializing.  We will always be available to say hello and chat but understand if you prefer to spend your time in the bedroom on your own.  We provide Netflix for this very reason!  
We are always available by text or message if you need anything at all during your stay.

Please view the listing guidebook for some area attractions we frequent. 
The South Loop is just a few minutes south of Downtown, near Soldier Field, Chinatown and Mccormick Place. Our intersection is Wabash Ave and Cullerton St please look this up in advance for our specific location. We are just a few minutes from most popular tourist destinations such as Museum Campus and have many public transit options right around the corner to take you to the Magnificent Mile shopping, Art institute and Millennium Park.
Chicago Museums are a 10min walk from the front door and Michigan Ave shopping is a short train or Lyft away.  The neighborhood was once known as Motor Row and was home to many car dealerships and vehicle associations.  Our loft was once an auto parts warehouse many, many years ago.  
Our home is  very close to Mccormick place, Northerly Island, Chinatown, Pilsen and downtown making it a very accessible and convenient location for all. Nearby restaurants include: Reggies Rock Bar, Windy City BBQ, Jamaican Jerk Chicken Villa, Opart Thai, Burger Pointe, Pizano's Pizza, Cafe Bionda and Spoke and Bird to name a few.

We are One block from the Mccormick Place Green line station and four blocks from the Chinatown redline station.  Buses that run down State St and Michigan Ave. are one block away and there are Divvy bike shares on the corner. 
On foot walking to the museums and millennium park will take 25-30mins. Michigan Ave shopping is 10mins away by train as are most other downtown attractions like Navy Pier.

There are two flights of stairs leading up to our loft, no elevator on site. 
Also expect typical amounts of city street noise such as sirens, cars and people. 
Again, the common areas such as bathroom and kitchen are shared with my husband and I and our 2 bulldogs.

You may drop off luggage before check in time but once you check out you must take your luggage with you.

Luggage storage is available from 
Usebounce.com and luggage hero.

Parking is available via spot hero.","Check In times are flexible, check out is 10am, luggage storage is available before check in, luggage must be taken with you upon checkout.

Bronzeville neighborhood. Perfect for young professionals, tourists, or creatively-oriented folks.

Located in a building with large windows, original flooring and wood-work, our apartment is a mix of old and new—a touch of mid-century and contemporary details, with many plants and art by local and international artists giving the apartment that irresistible eclectic note. 

Welcome!

Access to the shared areas and a washer/drier (in the unit), with understanding that this is our home we are welcoming you into it. 

We recently installed shades in the bedroom and touched up our back patio, where guests can lounge surrounded by a variety of lush plants.

The apartment is a work-and-live space that my partner and I share. We are LGBTQ friendly, artistically oriented couple who loves their home, art, and life. As we work from home and we are mostly around we are open to answer to any questions you might have as well as provide advice and suggestions for getting around Chicago.

There is a cute sandwich place, a relaxing coffee shop, and a convenience store located just around the corner. Walking distance to the famous Chicago’s Home of Chicken and Waffle. 

Bronzeville is located on the South Side of Chicago known for its rich history. In the early 20th century, Bronzeville was known as the ""Black Metropolis"", one of the nation's most significant concentrations of  Black owned businesses. The apartment is located a couple of blocks from the 47th street, the hub of the Bronzeville, with restaurants, galleries, and a variety of shops. 

Short commute to University of Chicago and Hyde Park—where the Obama house is located and the soon to come Obama Library. You can also visit the Hyde Park Art Center or other friendly and diverse businesses that cater to audiences from all around the world.

A 5 min walk to the city train (Green and rush hour Express Red Lines) or multiple bus lines, with a quick 20 minutes ride to the Loop/Chicago downtown area and its tourist destinations, including the Art Institute, Millennium Park and the famous Bean sculpture, Chicago Cultural Center, Magnificent Mile, the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA), and others.

We'll share the bathroom, living room (my office is also in the living room), kitchen, and back porch. Kitchen is stocked with all the basic appliances you need to cook, a coffee maker, blender, juicer, toaster oven and water filter on tap. Help yourself to several teas to choose from.

I'm friendly, outgoing and a great host (If I do say so myself!).  I'll let you do your own thing, but I can offer tips for getting around and things to do in the neighborhood/city if you'd like. I work from home, so I'm in my living room office during the day. I've got a busy social calendar, so I'm usually out at night, but I'm assuming you will be too! You're on your own for food, but the fridge and kitchen are yours to use.

Located in a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood of Irving Park (on the border of Albany Park). Albany Park is one of the most culturally diverse neighborhoods in the U.S. It offers many ethnic restaurants, with acclaimed Mexican, Lebanese and Persian all within walking distance. There are also several watering holes nearby, where you can enjoy local brews and live music. It's very easy to get anywhere in the city from here via CTA bus or L train, and the I-90/94 expressway is nearby. 

In case you run out of anything, there is a CVS, Walgreens and 7-11 within walking distance. Starbucks too!

The #78 Montrose bus is on the corner of my street. It's a 4 block walk to the Kedzie brown line ""L"" stop, and a 5 block walk to the #80 Irving Park bus. All 3 are great options to get you to Wrigley Field within 20-30 minutes or downtown/Millennium Park in 45-50 minutes. Also, the Montrose blue line ""L"" stop is not far if you're coming from O'Hare. Approximately a 30 minute drive to O'Hare or downtown, and a 15 minute drive to Wrigley Field. Uber/Lyft always arrive within 5 minutes. There's a Divvy bike station 4 blocks away on Kedzie/Sunnyside, and it's a quick 20 minute ride to beautiful Montrose beach (or take the #78 bus 3.5 miles east). G00gle maps does a great job of including Chicago public transportation and biking on their routes, but I can definitely help you figure out directions as well. 

Parking on my street is free/not zoned and very easy during the day, however it gets full at night. You may need to drive around the block a couple times until you find a spot, and possibly park a block away. Worst case scenario is to park at the meter spots on Montrose/Spaulding, free overnight between 9pm-8am.

I’ve received comments in the past that the upstairs neighbors walking around can be pretty loud, so if communal space noises are bothersome to you, my unit may not be the one for you. I provide a white noise machine and ear plugs for sensitive sleepers.","•Building quiet hours are 10pm-6am. 
•Renters over 25 years old. 
•No parties. 
•No additional overnight guests.
•No smoking inside the house (outside is ok).
•Please eat in dining areas only.
•AirBnB rule: We require Airbnb reservations booked for personal travel to be booked by the person who's going to stay at the listing.

This is my home, so please just treat it like you'd treat your own. This is a 16-unit building and the usual communal-living noises are to be expected, but I try to keep it pretty quiet. I just ask that you give my neighbors the same respect you'd give your own.","I'm friendly, outgoing and a great host (If I do say so myself!).

street parking with good lighting on side street and front street.,"Modest, traditional Chicago style apartment built in 1902. Located at the western end of the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. It is walking distance to UIC, Rush, County, and Mount Sinai Medical centers- and situated between Taylor and Roosevelt. This makes it Easy to drive into the city (2 miles to Willis tower) or hop onto CTA bus (stops in front of the building). Also there are a number of bars and restaurants along both streets that are easily walkable to, w/the first bar across the street from here

Great place for any medical school student, resident physician, or other medical personnel in need of an all-bills-included-furnished apartment for a few weeks up to a couple of months. 

I understand the struggle of completing away rotations and the logistical hardship it places on us. 

Please remember that the living room, kitchen, and bathroom are shared spaces. This is a hostel type situation and you may as up to 5 guests (at guest rate) split between the living room Vinci bed and spare air mattress- availability dependent.

Plenty of free street parking with good lighting on side street and front street.

Searching for that funky Uptown vibe? Just north of Downtown Chicago, the hip, tree-lined, brick building-filled Uptown neighborhood is where you go if you want a break from the craziness of the city. It’s located right on the water, and it’s just a 5-minute train ride to Wrigley Field (Go Cubs!).

 If you’ll be heading Downtown during your stay, you’re only a 10-minute walk from the Wilson CTA station, which will get you into the city in 30 minutes. You’ll find cozy coffee shops, trendy restaurants, and even a Walgreens nearby.

Need a little caffeine boost to start your Windy City morning? Everybody’s Coffee is a cheery neighborhood coffeehouse known for their sustainable crop-to-cup creations, tasty pastries, and staff smiles - and it’s just a 5-minute walk from our place. And don’t just take our word for it; this java joint was voted one of the five places to go in Chicago by The New York Times, received a shoutout from Conde Nast Traveler as one of the 14 best coffee shops in Chicago, and was voted best coffee shop in Uptown by Time Out Chicago.

Wandering around Chi-Town will definitely work up an appetite, so meander on over to the The Reservoir if you’re craving a tasty American meal. Here you will find upscale pub food like craft burgers, charcuterie boards, and small bar bites. With a rotating list of beers (including lots of local brews!), you might just find your new favorite bottle of suds. 

In the mood for something delicious and nutritious? Head next door to Loving Heart Vegan Cafe. This cozy eatery serves up all-vegan dishes including wraps, salads, burgers, and soups. Their scrumptious sweets will also have you questioning whether or not they are actually vegan (they are). And that means they must be healthy, so treat yourself!

Craving cracker jacks? You’re in luck! Wrigley Field is just a 7-minute train ride from Wilson Station. Or, give your legs a pre-seventh inning stretch and walk down N Sheridan Road - it will only take 25 minutes.

If you’re up for a relaxing walk over the weekend, you can’t miss the Peace Garden. This landscaped park will give you the perfect backdrop to unwind and catch some fresh air. Then head over to Montrose Point Bird Sanctuary for some serious nature sounds. Here you can find a variety of migrating songbirds while admiring the Chicago’s classic skyline. Montrose Beach is also a perfect location for a weekend picnic.

Hop on the Red Line at Wilson Station and you’re only a 20-minute train ride from the city’s bustling Magnificent Mile. This iconic Chicago district is complete with upscale shops and posh restaurants. One of our favorite little jewels of this area is Gino’s East. This long-running pizzeria fires up authentic deep dish and thin crust pizza, and may just be one of the city’s finest. Their pizzas are so popular they even offer nationwide shipping for those who can’t get enough (we’re not kidding). Now, that’s amore! You can enjoy a local classic and add your name on their wall of signatures.

Walking, taking the train, and using rideshare services (Uber and Lyft) are our recommended modes of transport. Unless you like paying for overpriced parking garages!

Wilson CTA train station is a nice 10-minute walk from our place. The train can then take you directly into downtown in just 30 minutes, which gives you plenty of time to browse the morning news while sipping on your latte. Or give your friends back home a serious case of FOMO by sharing some scenic Windy City shots.

Limited street parking is available, but not reliable, so we don’t recommend renting a car. However, Uber and Lyft are always an option for those looking to ride in style and venture a little further around town.

Our condo is a 30-minute drive northwest of Downtown Chicago, conveniently situated to give you a nice balance between exciting city life and relaxed suburban vibes. It’s close enough to the city for weekday commutes yet far enough to give you space to relax after a long week. And with a grocery store right across the street, you will always be minutes away from food or any other necessities you may need throughout your stay. 

If you enjoy cooking, we have a Jewel-Osco grocery store right across the street. They sell fresh produce, countless snacks, and have a fantastic beer, wine, and spirits collection. So if you’re craving an afternoon libation but don’t want to venture far, you’re in luck!

Within half a mile you will find two local restaurants where you can enjoy a meal with locals. The first is the Gale Street Inn Chicago. This neighborhood rib joint has been serving signature ribs in a friendly atmosphere since 1963. And if you can’t make their 3pm-5:45pm happy hour, no need to worry, the happiness continues from 9pm-11pm at the bar.

Another local favorite is Galvin's Public House. This family-owned Irish pub loves serving up pints, showing sports games, and entertaining guests with their live DJ nights. They have daily drink and food specials, so be sure to check their website for an updated listing. Oh, and did we mention they have a fireplace in the dining room?

Craving some international cuisine? Pho No.1 Vietnamese Cuisine is right around the corner from Galvin’s. Pho No. 1 is where you can grab a quick, healthy bite and be in and out in no time. They have a variety of healthy options and are known for their large portions and fast service.

Jefferson Park is a 6 min walk from our place and is a nice little spot to relax on the weekends. Grab a picnic lunch and enjoy reading a book while you soak up some sunshine. You might also be lucky enough to stumble upon their Sunday farmer’s market. Roberts Square Park is just under a mile but worth the trip. The park’s lush green grass makes it perfect for people watching or getting in a refreshing run.

Our place is a 12-minute drive from O’Hare International Airport and a short drive into Downtown Chicago.

Although we have a Jewel-Osco grocery store across the street and some restaurants nearby, we recommend either renting a car or taking rideshares (Uber or Lyft). Having access to a vehicle, whether your own or a rideshare, will most definitely make your stay more enjoyable. Within a 10-minute ride from our place, you will have access to a variety of different restaurants and public parks. And the Kennedy Expressway (I-90/94) is only 3 minutes away.

If you’re going to be making weekly trips into Downtown and looking for convenience, driving will take anywhere from 45 minutes to 90 minutes depending on traffic. Although we offer free parking in a garage, taking the train into Downtown might be your best bet. From our place, it’s a nice 10-minute walk to Jefferson Park Station, then a 30-minute ride into the city.

Our Charming 2bed/1bath unit is perfect for both leisure & business travelers.

We are conveniently located between O'hare & Downtown in the very safe Jefferson Park Neighborhood and short distance to Jefferson Park Transit Center (Trains) & Highways.","Our place is a 12-minute drive from O’Hare International Airport and a short drive into Downtown Chicago.

Although we have a Jewel-Osco grocery store across the street and some restaurants nearby, we recommend either renting a car or taking rideshares (Uber or Lyft). Having access to a vehicle, whether your own or a rideshare, will most definitely make your stay more enjoyable. Within a 10-minute ride from our place, you will have access to a variety of different restaurants and public parks. And the Kennedy Expressway (I-90/94) is only 3 minutes away.

If you’re going to be making weekly trips into Downtown and looking for convenience, driving will take anywhere from 45 minutes to 90 minutes depending on traffic. Although we offer free parking in a garage, taking the train into Downtown might be your best bet. From our place, it’s a nice 10-minute walk to Jefferson Park Station, then a 30-minute ride into the city.",True,True,False,False,,True,False,75.0,"[{'milestones': {'titles': ['<b>Jan 11, 3:00PM</b>', 'Check-in'], 'subtitles': [], 'type': 'check_in'}, 'localized_cancellation_policy_name': 'Strict', 'cancellation_policy_label': 'strict_14_with_grace_period', 'cancellation_policy_price_type': None, 'cancellation_policy_price_factor': 0.0, 'cancellation_policy_id': 44, 'book_it_module_tooltip': 'After that, cancel before 3:00PM on Jan 4 and get a 50% refund, minus the service fee.', 'subtitle': 'After that, cancel before 3:00PM on Jan 4 and get a 50% refund, minus the service fee.'}]",0.0,0.0,0,2020-01-11,2020-01-12,2019-12-28,2019-12-23 21:37:19+00:00,2018-07-31 18:08:23+00:00

Walk to nearby bars and restaurants, grocery stores, the 606 trail, coffee shops and beautiful parks. Come stay with us and enjoy all that Logan Square has to offer!

Garden unit with funky, urban appeal.  Slightly lower ceilings (about 7 1/2 feet), but you'll barely notice as it has a very spacious feel and FANTASTIC bright, natural light throughout the day.  We have a fully-stocked game shelf and a bookshelf with tons of great reads, plus a TV with Chromecast so you can watch shows from your Netflix/Amazon/Hulu/YouTube etc.  There is a very comfortable queen-sized bed, a futon couch, and a lovely chaise lounge (not pictured) for lounging.  Two bar stool chairs and a small dining table or sit at the kitchen bar to eat.  We have a fully-stocked kitchen with stove, refrigerator, microwave, toaster oven, coffee maker and plenty of pots and pans and cooking utensils, and you will have access to our grill for BBQing.  Feel free to relax in our yard - we have a deck with a large table and chairs and plenty of places to sit among the garden boxes boasting fresh veggies all summer long!

Guests will have access to the entire private apartment, plus our yard.

We are available by phone, text and email at any time.

We love our quiet, residential corner of Logan Square, especially because there are so many restaurants, bars, and shops within walking distance! Some of our favorites just within a few blocks are: Wyler Road (great craft beer and gourmet sandwiches), Weegees (speakeasy bar, with a shuffleboard table and outdoor garden), Ground Control (the BEST vegan/vegetarian food ever), Best Intentions (hip yet laid-back bar with a great cocktails, hip snacks, and a huge beer garden), Rico Fresh taqueria (small neighborhood taqueria tucked inside one of the grocery stores within walking distance - the huevos rancheros for breakfast are amazing if you can handle spicy!), Damn Fine Coffee (local roaster, great coffee and pastries), L'Patron tacos (there are no words to describe how much we love this place - unique, delicious tacos, etc), and so, so, so much more! Two great grocery stores within walking distance (Tony's and Rico Fresh), and tons more restaurants, bars, and one-of-a-kind shops just a 20 minute walk or 7 minute drive to the heart of Logan Square. If you need restaurant recommendations, just ask! We know lots of great places and can cater to whatever you're in the mood for. Also be sure to take a stroll through beautiful Palmer Square park. There's a 1/2 mile walking/jogging path and lots of shady trees to sit beneath and watch the city go by.

There are now 3 bedrooms, including a large mastersuite, on the upper level and 1 on the main level which serves as a multi-purpose room, including a guest room with 2 single beds when needed.  There is ample room/seating for 6 - 8 guests who can spread out in the 4 common areas.  Additionally, guests are welcome to use the outdoor space which brings added comfort and is good for outdoor dining, relaxing or small gatherings.

Hence you will see signs on the windows that you will not be able to open the garden unit windows or alarm will go off. We have central air and heat so should temperature be a problem we can fix that for you. 

We also have a bidet in our guest bathroom that is only to be used and operated by adults, if desired, to make sure it’s is turned off completely and not left on. Our treadmill gym is only to be used by adults not children. If you want to use it to work out we will give you the power key. Access to cable TV and Netflix.

The apartment was completely renovated during the past year and is located on the first floor of a three story century old vintage brick building, locally known as a three flat. Redone in the style of a ""soft loft"" the unit has 10 foot ceilings, spiral duct work, newly refinished hardwood maple floors and an exposed brick wall in the kitchen. This bedroom is one of two in the apartment and has a queen size bed and a large walk in closet. The apartment is shared- at a maximum - with one other person. Each guest has their own bedroom. Each bedroom door has a keyed lock.

Marshall Square, adjacent to the better known Pilsen area, was settled and built largely by Czechs in the later part of the 19th  and early 20th century. Buildings are almost exclusively brick with attractive facades and are separated by narrow ""gangways"". While not one of Chicago's trendier areas, transportation links into the Loop are excellent, with a train station at the end of the block and less than a 20 minute ride to the Loop. The neighborhood is predominately Mexican now, with many excellent and inexpensive restaurants. Laguinitas Brewery and Pub is just a few blocks away as is Cinespace Movie Studio, where several network and cable tv shows are filmed.

EARLY CHECK-IN / LATE CHECK-OUT
May be possible pending availability. Rates are as follows:
1-3 hours of standard check-in/check-out time $50
3+ hours subject to a half day rate or standard $125

CHECK-OUT TIME
Check-out time is prompt at 11 AM.  We would love to let you stay forever, but the issue is we have someone checking in right after you.  If you have not been approved for a late check-out, you will be subject to a $50 fine each 15 minute interval that you delay the Cleaning Team.  We value our Cleaner's Team time and work and hope you do as well.  A delayed checkout only causes stress and extra work for them.   We hope you understand, so please make sure to check out on time in order to avoid any fine.  If a late checkout time is mandatory, please make sure to make arrangements upon booking.  We will do our best to accommodate your request pending availability.  

SECURITY 
Must provide copy of photo ID upon booking via the message center or via email to stay@bangtel.com  
PHOTOSHOOTS/FILMS
If you are booking for a Photoshoot or Production, we have special rates for you and all shoots must be approved prior to booking.  

PARTIES / EVENTS
Additional refundable security deposit will be taken for parties and events.  

Additional fees apply for any guests over the maximum allowed number of guests on the listing.  Parties and event fees are based on a case by case basis, number of guests, and duration of the event. 

PARTY GLITTER & CONFETTI FEE
Those small little shiny fun circles are not fun at all for our cleaning team to pick up.  They are actually a nightmare for the clean-up team and we politely warn you that there will be an additional fee for sprinkling glitter or confetti.  Please note, you are more than welcome to wear that lovely sequined jumpsuit, by all means bring it to the party. ;-)

SHOES
No matter how fabulous your shoes are we do ask that you PLEASE remove them when in the house.

FLOORING
PLEASE only use the Rubio Monocoat to clean or wipe the floors on the third floor.  The cleaner is clearly labeled and located in a spray bottle under the kitchen sink. 
 
NO SMOKING PLEASE
There is absolutely no smoking allowed in the unit.  You are welcome to smoke outside, but please dispose in the provided ashtrays. There is a $500 fine for smoking in the unit.

PETS

Completely remodeled apartment.

Keyless entry.  The space is a completely separate apartment.  You will have your own private access to come and go from the space as you wish.

We live upstairs in our own separate apartment.  We can have as much or as little interaction with you as you would like.  Someone should be available at all times should you need assistance.

Andersonville was originally developed by Swiss immigrants.  In the 80s and 90s a population of gay and lesbian artists entered the area and the artistry remains today.   Lots of galleries and boutiques to walk to and be sure to visit The Women and Children First Bookstore!   Some of the best chefs in downtown open their second location right here on Clarke St.  But you can still enjoy good, cheap eats at Pauline's Diner just two blocks away, which has been serving food to local residents for decades!

Free parking is available on our street for those who may be renting a car.   In good weather, there are bus and train options within minutes walk of the house to take you anywhere in the city.   There are plenty of Lyft and Uber options nearly any time of day or night as well.

**We are only accepting guests that have been reviewed by other hosts.**  Please do not request to stay with us if you are brand new to AirBnB and do not yet have any reviews from other hosts.  Unfortunately we have been burned in the past and now we use this review system to confirm that guests are who they say they are.

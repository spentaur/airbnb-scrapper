I am at the location for most of the  bookings, the bedroom is private with a lockable door,i sleep in living room on sofa bed when I am  there. So the space is open,not private.

These synonymous neighborhoods are famous for live music and nightlife, chef-driven restaurants and countless art galleries — many housed within the Flat Iron Arts Building.

Privacy Statement on the Use of Security Cameras:
We respect and value the privacy of our guests. We will never place a camera inside a living space. While Airbnb policy allows cameras in spaces that are not used for sleeping or bathing, we disagree. Cameras should be banned from inside all living spaces. Footage should be automatically deleted. Everything should be disclosed in advance. We use hallway security cameras to verify the number of guests who have entered an apartment. This is useful for stopping parties, and under additional prices extra guest charges may apply for extra people sleeping over. We use a camera on the balcony to monitor for smoking. This area is publicly visible from the street. All footage is deleted automatically after a stay, unless there is an open resolution center case. It’s unfortunate that not every guest is honest about their intentions, and our community would not allow us to be on Airbnb if we did not prevent unwanted behaviors.

PARKING
ONE outdoor parking space is included with this rental. The space is yours from 12PM the day of check-in until 11AM the day of check-out, but not before or after. We will provide you with the space number. We have recommendations for paid parking if you need additional spaces. XL vehicles like Ford Expedition or F-450 will not fit in these 96"" wide spaces. If you go over the line, you'll be towed.
----------
CHECK-IN TIME 
Typically, guests may receive the keys and drop their bags in the apartment as early as 12PM (noon). The cleaners do need until 4PM to do their work, and the apartment may be dirty anytime until 4.  
If you'd like to drop your bags early and head out until the cleaners finish, we can usually accommodate you! If you'd like to take a nap or shower right away, and the night before your stay isn't booked yet, let's discuss booking that night before! Then you could arrive as early as you'd like that day! 
----------
CHECK-OUT TIME
11AM is check-out. If you'll need a check-out after 11AM, and the night after your stay isn't booked yet, let's chat about booking that next night! Then you could leave as late as you'd like that day!
We *do* have a luggage locker a block away!
----------
OCCUPANCY 
Upon booking, your reservation will have paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number whether visiting or sleeping,  you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first. 
We consider the maximum capacity of the apartment to be its sleeping capacity - eight individuals. Anyone past eight would not be permitted. 
Enjoy the city! Please don’t bring a party back.
----------
RATES
Rates and minimum stays change constantly - every night is different! 
The nightly rate changes based on number of guests, which is verified upon arrival. Please do your best to let me know how many guests will be staying in advance!
----------
The pictures you see have accurate furniture, finishes, square footage - really everything! The art and positioning of items *might* be slightly different. Please don’t be concerned! Read the reviews! I assure you that the photos accurately represent what you will receive!

The entire apartment is yours during your stay!

WICKER PARK! 
The apartment is located in the center of Chicago's hipster haven! This awesome neighborhood has so many bars, restaurants, independent coffee joints and quirky shops you'll have no idea where to start - until you check out our curated guidebook! We'll give you a taste for starters.

CHEESIES, a casual bar up Milwaukee Avenue, has killer grilled cheese. The Popper is the best choice on the menu. We've only been after a few drinks, but we see people there all day. Good sign. 
EMPORIUM ARCADE BAR WICKER PARK is great for games and drinks. The cocktails are a little pricey, but you can play pinball for hours.  
PIECE PIZZA AND BREWERY has the best New Haven style pizza outside of Connecticut, and even better, it's not from New York! Their Hefeweizen is top notch, and they have live music all the time.
And at PODHALANKA you'll experience a Polish grandmother's welcome by stuffing you with blintzes, pierogies, and roast beef - and not taking 'please, no more' for an answer. 

We’ve got tips about hidden speakeasy’s and burlesque shows, coffee shops and grab-and-go breakfast, high-end can't miss dinners, quick meals, late nights and boozy brunch, plus extensive day trips all throughout the city. We put our heart into it, and you’ll find advice on other can’t-miss places worth a train or Uber ride, including FIVE distinct nightlife districts throughout the city!

There's no need for a car here!

PARKING
ONE outdoor parking space is included with this rental. The space is yours from 12PM the day of check-in until 11AM the day of check-out, but not before or after. We will provide you with the space number. We have recommendations for paid parking if you need additional spaces. XL vehicles like Ford Expedition or F-450 will not fit in these 96"" wide spaces. If you go over the line, you'll be towed.
----------
CHECK-IN TIME 
Typically, guests may receive the keys and drop their bags in the apartment as early as 12PM (noon). The cleaners do need until 4PM to do their work, and the apartment may be dirty anytime until 4.  
If you'd like to drop your bags early and head out until the cleaners finish, we can usually accommodate you! If you'd like to take a nap or shower right away, and the night before your stay isn't booked yet, let's discuss booking that night before! Then you could arrive as early as you'd like that day! 
----------
CHECK-OUT TIME
11AM is check-out. If you'll need a check-out after 11AM, and the night after your stay isn't booked yet, let's chat about booking that next night! Then you could leave as late as you'd like that day!
We *do* have a luggage locker a block away!
----------
OCCUPANCY 
Upon booking, your reservation will have paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number whether visiting or sleeping,  you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first. 
We consider the maximum capacity of the apartment to be its sleeping capacity - eight individuals. Anyone past eight would not be permitted. 
Enjoy the city! Please don’t bring a party back.
----------
RATES
Rates and minimum stays change constantly - every night is different! 
The nightly rate changes based on number of guests, which is verified upon arrival. Please do your best to let me know how many guests will be staying in advance!
----------
The pictures you see have accurate furniture, finishes, square footage - really everything! The art and positioning of items *might* be slightly different. Please don’t be concerned!

I live nearby and can generally provide in person help when needed.  Pretty much always available by phone.

nights at 20% off OR 30+ at 25% off! 

The best of both worlds! Recently renovated two-story condo in Old Town with all modern amenities,  in a classic 19th century Chicago home in one of the oldest parts of the city. Ideal for traveling families and friends, and plenty of Chicago culture nearby, from nearly every era. A neighborhood bar with Frank Sinatra's favorite ribs! Michelin-starred restaurants! And only 20 minutes to the Loop on the train - book today!

When you enter - via private entrance - you walk up a set of stairs into an open living room / dining room / kitchen with soaring ceilings. Down a hallway are two bedrooms: one with a King-sized bed and an en-suite bathroom, and one with a Queen-sized bed. There's another full bathroom along the hallway as well, and the washer and dryer. Up a set of stairs from the living room is an additional bedroom with a Twin-sized bed. The couch in the living room functions as another Twin-sized bed.

You'll have full access to my entire two-story condo.

An incredibly popular neighborhood destination, largely because of its close proximity to the lake and downtown, Old Town keeps up a lively pace day and night. Victorian-era buildings, brick alleyways and narrow, tree-lined streets are charming backdrops to a busy main strip that runs along Wells Street between North Avenue and Division Street.

I'm a 5 minute walk to the Sedgwick Brown line stop, and just as close to the North Ave and Halsted bus lines - it's easy to get around town without a car from here! There's street parking in the neighborhood if you'll have a car with you, however.

The Near West Side , one of the 77 community areas of Chicago, is on the West Side, west of the Chicago River and adjacent to the Loop and West Loop. The history of the Near West Side of Chicago includes the founding of Hull House, a prominent settlement house. The Great Chicago Fire started in the Near West Side. The area is home to the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), the United Center and the Illinois Medical not a very walkable neighborhood, but bigger streets such as Madison and Western are more interesting to walk through but only after 1 mile you will hit the posh neighborhoods. Listing is on Western and Madison intersection.

My listings are very close to public transportation. The bus stop is right on the intersection and my house is 5th from a major intersection with 2 buses.  The way chicago works is that each bus goes in a straight line. Madison bus goes to downtown, loop, Sears (Willis) tower and Millennium Park, and Western bus goes to different neighborhoods such as Bucktown and Wicker Park and Medical District.  Blue line is about 8 minute walk, and also goes to downtown, loop and the airport.  Also if you get Uber and use UberPool, its only about $2.50-3$ to get around which is not that much different sometimes from public transportation prices ($2.25).","Please do not wear shoes in the house.

The layout allows for a lot of privacy as your rooms and bathroom are located in the basement area of my home. I work from home and occupy the upstairs. I operate an Organic Catering Company called ""Goose & Fox"", as well as a recording studio. The building itself is over 100 years old and located in awesome part of town.

You have the privacy of your own bathroom & bedroom, as well as an office with an extra futon and an extra bed.

I try to give my guests as much space as I think they want or need. 

If I am around, I am accessible but not in your space, meaning I am working in my office with the door slightly cracked or doing something upstairs while you are downstairs in your bedroom or bathroom. I also operate a recording studio so sometimes I am upstairs recording stuff. I also have two friendly dogs who generally hang with me in the office. They sometimes bark when people arrive but are super friendly after a couple minutes. They do not have access to the basement. 

On the other hand, if you need answers or just want to talk, I always enjoy this part of the host experience.

I try to let the guest set the pace when it comes to how much interaction we have.

The place is located in the heart of Historic Lincoln Park with easy access to the Armitage Brown Line stop and the ""el"".  We are in the best possible location if you need access to downtown we are literally a 5-10 minute train ride away.

Lincoln Park is home to DePaul University and boasts tree-lined lakefront paths for biking/jogging, a vibrant shopping district, beach, dozens of ethnically diverse restaurants, live music venues, movie theaters and more. north avenue beach, and the lakefront, are less than 10 minutes from our home.

Breakfast is offered at an additional charge with your stay but you must verify the time  you want prior to your arrival or the day before when you arrive. Breakfast can be served at any time and is cooked to order so you can sleep in if you need to, but you must arrange it with the host so we can make sure we have everything we need to give you a great breakfast. 

-free coffee/tea during your entire stay 
-full cooked to order breakfast (omelettes, frittattas, potatoes, french toast, pancakes, locally sourced bacon, biscuits & gravy, eggs benedict. special dietary needs are no problem! Your Host is a world class Chef so we can pretty much make anything and it will always be awesome!

I DO NOT PROVIDE PARKING. STOP ASKING ME ABOUT PARKING. WE ARE LOCATED IN A LARGE CITY. PARKING IS DIFFICULT. Public transit is a much better option.

Buses and trains are literally ride outside my front door and about a minute walk from the apartment (train ride downtown is then only a 10 minute ride)

Cabs: No more than a moments wait to flag a cab directly out front of my place day and night. This is a safe area where you can walk around at night as well.

Parking: We are about 5 minutes from downtown so Parking is limited, random and mostly based on luck like any populated urban area. research the neighborhood and plan ahead. I do not provide parking and due to the popularity of the area my recommendations will only go so far. Our location is great for public transit, which we recommend you use.

Hostels provide budget-oriented, sociable accommodation where guests can rent a bed, usually a bunk bed, in a dormitory and share a bathroom, lounge and sometimes a kitchen. 

There are several differences between hostels and hotels, including:
Hostels tend to be budget-oriented; rates are considerably lower.
For those who prefer an informal environment, hostels do not usually have the same level of formality as hotels.
For those who prefer to socialize with their fellow guests, hostels usually have more common areas and opportunities to socialize. The dormitory aspect of hostels also increases the social factor.
Hostels are generally self-catering.

PLEASE DO NOT 
- Do anything illegal 
- Smoke inside (Thank You) 
- Invite guests over without prior written approval 
-ask me about parking (do the research, google directions)


Valid IDs will be required upon checking in. 
I can be very flexible with move in and move out times as long as I can get the apartment cleaned for the next airbnb client

DISCLAIMER! 
Now that I have hosted for over a year, I generally prefer more laid back guests who have experience with airbnb. Specifically, Millenials, Artistic types and younger folks going to concerts, work trips etc. This space is not exactly the four seasons but I do my best to make it comfy and affordable. If you are an older more discerning traveler who is going to not follow the rules, read my ad or at least  send me some basic info on the why, when and where when you attempt to book it probably be best for you to stay at a hotel. I also tend to only book people who have experience with home sharing, as new guests tend to not follow the simple requests and like to write 5 paragraph essays on the stain they found on the bathtub.","Please just be Respectful of the House and be Housebroken!

Our 2 unit building is on a quiet tree-lined street, away from the rowdiness and noise of the party streets but still affords you walking access to a huge variety of exceptional restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, entertainment, and an 11 minute walk to Wrigley Field. Our apartment is a great home base to get around the whole city and also relax away from the crowds. Parking permits provided.

We have been part of the Lakeview fabric for over 30 years. We bought our 1890's house over 20 years ago and rehabbed it then. The apartment has 10 foot ceilings and is duplexed down (2 floors) into the garden level where the 2nd and 3rd bedrooms are located. If you played college basketball, you may have to duck your head a bit downstairs. 

Our street is very quiet and neighborly, (many on the street raised their kids here - including us), but close enough to walk to the areas that makes our neighborhood so vibrant. 

Access to the Southport stop on the Brown line ""L"" is 3 minutes by foot, which will get you to the apartment or all over the city; but why go anywhere else, Lakeview/Southport Corridor has it all. :)

Our in home  “Welcome Book” will give you many recommendations for the neighborhood (restaurants, bars, activities, shopping, theater etc). We are Airbnb'ers too, so we have met many different hosts. Our style is fluid; if you need anything or recommendations, we can help. If you are here to chill, that is alright with us too. We are here to give you the support you prefer!

Lakeview/Southport Corridor (the second largest neighborhood in the city) has it all and was voted the #3 big city neighborhood to live, IN THE COUNTRY! by MONEY MAGAZINE. Lakeview encircles the sub neighborhoods of East Lakeview, Central Lakeview, Southport Corridor, Boystown and Wrigleyville — parts of a sum that celebrates diversity, neighborhood living, along with something special for all visitors.

Make sure to hit all the Lakeview commercial streets:
•Belmont Avenue
•Lincoln Avenue
•Southport Avenue
•Halsted Street
•Broadway Avenue 

Here you will find, many locally owned shops/boutiques with clothing from funky vintage to time tested preppy (try to support the local businesses). Additionally the bars/taverns/pubs and dives are certainly places you can’t miss. We have an incredible micro brew scene (Chicago has 83 brewers), and bars of varying pedigree (sports, college designated, dive, music, gay, local watering holes etc) giving you unlimited choices.

We are one block off of Southport Ave which has exceptional food choices from fast casual to fine dining. We are sure you can find something in your wheel-house. Additionally, our bars run from young to sophisticated with everything in between. Southport Lanes right around the corner from the apartment even has a 3 lane bowling alleys with pins that are hand set.

Theater is alive and well in the neighborhood along with comedy, dance and small club music venues - visit the clubs that the major acts played when no one knew them along with some of the new bands on their way up. All within walking distance.  

Our in home  “Welcome Book” will give you many recommendations for the neighborhood.

If you don't need a car, don't bring one, Chicago is built for easy travel and our home is situated perfectly from O'Hare and Midway - your walk from the ""L"" or a CTA bus is only 3 blocks to the apartment. 

From the apartment, you have several close transit options:
Brown, Red, and Purple ""L"" Trains,
CTA Buses,
Divvy bike share rack is 2 blocks away,
Lyft, Uber and Taxi are abundant,
The best way - by foot

Lakeview is activity oriented and kid-friendly. Run or bike the lakeshore, play beach volleyball, kayak the river, grab a city shared-bike and explore the 606 trail and different neighborhoods. Take the ""L"" down to our world class museums or an architectural tour on the Chicago River. 

We have many kid friendly parks with the newest located 1 block away, which was paid for by the neighborhood families and the Cubs - it is awesome!

Parking is available on the streets, but is restricted to permits from 6p-6a and Cub games. We can help you with this.

Additionally, parking garages are nearby and parking services apps such as Spothero and ParkWhiz are very helpful and reasonable.","- All bookings require a security deposit of $700 or more. You will not be charged for this in advance.

Logan Square is consistently ranked one of the Top 25 hottest neighborhoods in the country. We have included some of our favorite spots on the site as well. Cubs fans you are only five miles from Wrigley Field. Park and Uber/Lyft to the game.

The strong neighborly connection is evident all around-community gardens and a locally-run farmers market. ""Local"" being the key word when describing many aspects of the scene: ingredients are sourced locally at their buzz-worthy restaurants; corner taps tout local, craft brews; galleries showcase local artists; and concerts and street fests promote local, upstart bands.

At the heart of this community is the actual ""square"" in Logan Square.  The boulevards themselves are widened thoroughfares that are set apart by grassy, landscaped medians and tall, stately trees that border both its sides. The neighborhood boasts four of them in total and these link together to form Chicago's ""Emerald Necklace,"" an expansive system of interconnected parks and streetscapes dotted with beautifully-restored mansions, handsome greystone homes and majestic churches.

Location: The home is located on a quiet tree-lined street. You are within walking distance to public transportation or a short drive via Uber/Lyft/personal vehicle away form all that the Logan Square neighborhood has to offer. The actual ""square"" and center of the neighborhood is approximately a 10-15 minute walk from the home, or 1-2 minute car ride away. The best way to get to the square is walking through the neighborhood and enjoying the historic Logan Square architecture.

Each guest is different and prefers a different amount of socializing.  We will always be available to say hello and chat but understand if you prefer to spend your time in the bedroom on your own.  We provide Netflix for this very reason!  
We are always available by text or message if you need anything at all during your stay.

Please view the listing guidebook for some area attractions we frequent. 
The South Loop is just a few minutes south of Downtown, near Soldier Field, Chinatown and Mccormick Place. Our intersection is Wabash Ave and Cullerton St please look this up in advance for our specific location. We are just a few minutes from most popular tourist destinations such as Museum Campus and have many public transit options right around the corner to take you to the Magnificent Mile shopping, Art institute and Millennium Park.
Chicago Museums are a 10min walk from the front door and Michigan Ave shopping is a short train or Lyft away.  The neighborhood was once known as Motor Row and was home to many car dealerships and vehicle associations.  Our loft was once an auto parts warehouse many, many years ago.  
Our home is  very close to Mccormick place, Northerly Island, Chinatown, Pilsen and downtown making it a very accessible and convenient location for all. Nearby restaurants include: Reggies Rock Bar, Windy City BBQ, Jamaican Jerk Chicken Villa, Opart Thai, Burger Pointe, Pizano's Pizza, Cafe Bionda and Spoke and Bird to name a few.

We are One block from the Mccormick Place Green line station and four blocks from the Chinatown redline station.  Buses that run down State St and Michigan Ave. are one block away and there are Divvy bike shares on the corner. 
On foot walking to the museums and millennium park will take 25-30mins. Michigan Ave shopping is 10mins away by train as are most other downtown attractions like Navy Pier.

There are two flights of stairs leading up to our loft, no elevator on site. 
Also expect typical amounts of city street noise such as sirens, cars and people. 
Again, the common areas such as bathroom and kitchen are shared with my husband and I and our 2 bulldogs.

You may drop off luggage before check in time but once you check out you must take your luggage with you.

Luggage storage is available from 
Usebounce.com and luggage hero.

Parking is available via spot hero.","Check In times are flexible, check out is 10am, luggage storage is available before check in, luggage must be taken with you upon checkout.

Bronzeville neighborhood. Perfect for young professionals, tourists, or creatively-oriented folks.

Located in a building with large windows, original flooring and wood-work, our apartment is a mix of old and new—a touch of mid-century and contemporary details, with many plants and art by local and international artists giving the apartment that irresistible eclectic note. 

Welcome!

Access to the shared areas and a washer/drier (in the unit), with understanding that this is our home we are welcoming you into it. 

We recently installed shades in the bedroom and touched up our back patio, where guests can lounge surrounded by a variety of lush plants.

The apartment is a work-and-live space that my partner and I share. We are LGBTQ friendly, artistically oriented couple who loves their home, art, and life. As we work from home and we are mostly around we are open to answer to any questions you might have as well as provide advice and suggestions for getting around Chicago.

There is a cute sandwich place, a relaxing coffee shop, and a convenience store located just around the corner. Walking distance to the famous Chicago’s Home of Chicken and Waffle. 

Bronzeville is located on the South Side of Chicago known for its rich history. In the early 20th century, Bronzeville was known as the ""Black Metropolis"", one of the nation's most significant concentrations of  Black owned businesses. The apartment is located a couple of blocks from the 47th street, the hub of the Bronzeville, with restaurants, galleries, and a variety of shops. 

Short commute to University of Chicago and Hyde Park—where the Obama house is located and the soon to come Obama Library. You can also visit the Hyde Park Art Center or other friendly and diverse businesses that cater to audiences from all around the world.

A 5 min walk to the city train (Green and rush hour Express Red Lines) or multiple bus lines, with a quick 20 minutes ride to the Loop/Chicago downtown area and its tourist destinations, including the Art Institute, Millennium Park and the famous Bean sculpture, Chicago Cultural Center, Magnificent Mile, the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA), and others.

We'll share the bathroom, living room (my office is also in the living room), kitchen, and back porch. Kitchen is stocked with all the basic appliances you need to cook, a coffee maker, blender, juicer, toaster oven and water filter on tap. Help yourself to several teas to choose from.

I'm friendly, outgoing and a great host (If I do say so myself!).  I'll let you do your own thing, but I can offer tips for getting around and things to do in the neighborhood/city if you'd like. I work from home, so I'm in my living room office during the day. I've got a busy social calendar, so I'm usually out at night, but I'm assuming you will be too! You're on your own for food, but the fridge and kitchen are yours to use.

Located in a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood of Irving Park (on the border of Albany Park). Albany Park is one of the most culturally diverse neighborhoods in the U.S. It offers many ethnic restaurants, with acclaimed Mexican, Lebanese and Persian all within walking distance. There are also several watering holes nearby, where you can enjoy local brews and live music. It's very easy to get anywhere in the city from here via CTA bus or L train, and the I-90/94 expressway is nearby. 

In case you run out of anything, there is a CVS, Walgreens and 7-11 within walking distance. Starbucks too!

The #78 Montrose bus is on the corner of my street. It's a 4 block walk to the Kedzie brown line ""L"" stop, and a 5 block walk to the #80 Irving Park bus. All 3 are great options to get you to Wrigley Field within 20-30 minutes or downtown/Millennium Park in 45-50 minutes. Also, the Montrose blue line ""L"" stop is not far if you're coming from O'Hare. Approximately a 30 minute drive to O'Hare or downtown, and a 15 minute drive to Wrigley Field. Uber/Lyft always arrive within 5 minutes. There's a Divvy bike station 4 blocks away on Kedzie/Sunnyside, and it's a quick 20 minute ride to beautiful Montrose beach (or take the #78 bus 3.5 miles east). G00gle maps does a great job of including Chicago public transportation and biking on their routes, but I can definitely help you figure out directions as well. 

Parking on my street is free/not zoned and very easy during the day, however it gets full at night. You may need to drive around the block a couple times until you find a spot, and possibly park a block away. Worst case scenario is to park at the meter spots on Montrose/Spaulding, free overnight between 9pm-8am.

I’ve received comments in the past that the upstairs neighbors walking around can be pretty loud, so if communal space noises are bothersome to you, my unit may not be the one for you. I provide a white noise machine and ear plugs for sensitive sleepers.","•Building quiet hours are 10pm-6am. 
•Renters over 25 years old. 
•No parties. 
•No additional overnight guests.
•No smoking inside the house (outside is ok).
•Please eat in dining areas only.
•AirBnB rule: We require Airbnb reservations booked for personal travel to be booked by the person who's going to stay at the listing.

This is my home, so please just treat it like you'd treat your own. This is a 16-unit building and the usual communal-living noises are to be expected, but I try to keep it pretty quiet. I just ask that you give my neighbors the same respect you'd give your own.","I'm friendly, outgoing and a great host (If I do say so myself!).

street parking with good lighting on side street and front street.,"Modest, traditional Chicago style apartment built in 1902. Located at the western end of the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. It is walking distance to UIC, Rush, County, and Mount Sinai Medical centers- and situated between Taylor and Roosevelt. This makes it Easy to drive into the city (2 miles to Willis tower) or hop onto CTA bus (stops in front of the building). Also there are a number of bars and restaurants along both streets that are easily walkable to, w/the first bar across the street from here

Great place for any medical school student, resident physician, or other medical personnel in need of an all-bills-included-furnished apartment for a few weeks up to a couple of months. 

I understand the struggle of completing away rotations and the logistical hardship it places on us. 

Please remember that the living room, kitchen, and bathroom are shared spaces. This is a hostel type situation and you may as up to 5 guests (at guest rate) split between the living room Vinci bed and spare air mattress- availability dependent.

Plenty of free street parking with good lighting on side street and front street.

Searching for that funky Uptown vibe? Just north of Downtown Chicago, the hip, tree-lined, brick building-filled Uptown neighborhood is where you go if you want a break from the craziness of the city. It’s located right on the water, and it’s just a 5-minute train ride to Wrigley Field (Go Cubs!).

 If you’ll be heading Downtown during your stay, you’re only a 10-minute walk from the Wilson CTA station, which will get you into the city in 30 minutes. You’ll find cozy coffee shops, trendy restaurants, and even a Walgreens nearby.

Need a little caffeine boost to start your Windy City morning? Everybody’s Coffee is a cheery neighborhood coffeehouse known for their sustainable crop-to-cup creations, tasty pastries, and staff smiles - and it’s just a 5-minute walk from our place. And don’t just take our word for it; this java joint was voted one of the five places to go in Chicago by The New York Times, received a shoutout from Conde Nast Traveler as one of the 14 best coffee shops in Chicago, and was voted best coffee shop in Uptown by Time Out Chicago.

Wandering around Chi-Town will definitely work up an appetite, so meander on over to the The Reservoir if you’re craving a tasty American meal. Here you will find upscale pub food like craft burgers, charcuterie boards, and small bar bites. With a rotating list of beers (including lots of local brews!), you might just find your new favorite bottle of suds. 

In the mood for something delicious and nutritious? Head next door to Loving Heart Vegan Cafe. This cozy eatery serves up all-vegan dishes including wraps, salads, burgers, and soups. Their scrumptious sweets will also have you questioning whether or not they are actually vegan (they are). And that means they must be healthy, so treat yourself!

Craving cracker jacks? You’re in luck! Wrigley Field is just a 7-minute train ride from Wilson Station. Or, give your legs a pre-seventh inning stretch and walk down N Sheridan Road - it will only take 25 minutes.

If you’re up for a relaxing walk over the weekend, you can’t miss the Peace Garden. This landscaped park will give you the perfect backdrop to unwind and catch some fresh air. Then head over to Montrose Point Bird Sanctuary for some serious nature sounds. Here you can find a variety of migrating songbirds while admiring the Chicago’s classic skyline. Montrose Beach is also a perfect location for a weekend picnic.

Hop on the Red Line at Wilson Station and you’re only a 20-minute train ride from the city’s bustling Magnificent Mile. This iconic Chicago district is complete with upscale shops and posh restaurants. One of our favorite little jewels of this area is Gino’s East. This long-running pizzeria fires up authentic deep dish and thin crust pizza, and may just be one of the city’s finest. Their pizzas are so popular they even offer nationwide shipping for those who can’t get enough (we’re not kidding). Now, that’s amore! You can enjoy a local classic and add your name on their wall of signatures.

Walking, taking the train, and using rideshare services (Uber and Lyft) are our recommended modes of transport. Unless you like paying for overpriced parking garages!

Wilson CTA train station is a nice 10-minute walk from our place. The train can then take you directly into downtown in just 30 minutes, which gives you plenty of time to browse the morning news while sipping on your latte. Or give your friends back home a serious case of FOMO by sharing some scenic Windy City shots.

Limited street parking is available, but not reliable, so we don’t recommend renting a car. However, Uber and Lyft are always an option for those looking to ride in style and venture a little further around town.

Our condo is a 30-minute drive northwest of Downtown Chicago, conveniently situated to give you a nice balance between exciting city life and relaxed suburban vibes. It’s close enough to the city for weekday commutes yet far enough to give you space to relax after a long week. And with a grocery store right across the street, you will always be minutes away from food or any other necessities you may need throughout your stay. 

If you enjoy cooking, we have a Jewel-Osco grocery store right across the street. They sell fresh produce, countless snacks, and have a fantastic beer, wine, and spirits collection. So if you’re craving an afternoon libation but don’t want to venture far, you’re in luck!

Within half a mile you will find two local restaurants where you can enjoy a meal with locals. The first is the Gale Street Inn Chicago. This neighborhood rib joint has been serving signature ribs in a friendly atmosphere since 1963. And if you can’t make their 3pm-5:45pm happy hour, no need to worry, the happiness continues from 9pm-11pm at the bar.

Another local favorite is Galvin's Public House. This family-owned Irish pub loves serving up pints, showing sports games, and entertaining guests with their live DJ nights. They have daily drink and food specials, so be sure to check their website for an updated listing. Oh, and did we mention they have a fireplace in the dining room?

Craving some international cuisine? Pho No.1 Vietnamese Cuisine is right around the corner from Galvin’s. Pho No. 1 is where you can grab a quick, healthy bite and be in and out in no time. They have a variety of healthy options and are known for their large portions and fast service.

Jefferson Park is a 6 min walk from our place and is a nice little spot to relax on the weekends. Grab a picnic lunch and enjoy reading a book while you soak up some sunshine. You might also be lucky enough to stumble upon their Sunday farmer’s market. Roberts Square Park is just under a mile but worth the trip. The park’s lush green grass makes it perfect for people watching or getting in a refreshing run.

Our place is a 12-minute drive from O’Hare International Airport and a short drive into Downtown Chicago.

Although we have a Jewel-Osco grocery store across the street and some restaurants nearby, we recommend either renting a car or taking rideshares (Uber or Lyft). Having access to a vehicle, whether your own or a rideshare, will most definitely make your stay more enjoyable. Within a 10-minute ride from our place, you will have access to a variety of different restaurants and public parks. And the Kennedy Expressway (I-90/94) is only 3 minutes away.

If you’re going to be making weekly trips into Downtown and looking for convenience, driving will take anywhere from 45 minutes to 90 minutes depending on traffic. Although we offer free parking in a garage, taking the train into Downtown might be your best bet. From our place, it’s a nice 10-minute walk to Jefferson Park Station, then a 30-minute ride into the city.

Our Charming 2bed/1bath unit is perfect for both leisure & business travelers.

We are conveniently located between O'hare & Downtown in the very safe Jefferson Park Neighborhood and short distance to Jefferson Park Transit Center (Trains) & Highways.","Our place is a 12-minute drive from O’Hare International Airport and a short drive into Downtown Chicago.

Although we have a Jewel-Osco grocery store across the street and some restaurants nearby, we recommend either renting a car or taking rideshares (Uber or Lyft). Having access to a vehicle, whether your own or a rideshare, will most definitely make your stay more enjoyable. Within a 10-minute ride from our place, you will have access to a variety of different restaurants and public parks. And the Kennedy Expressway (I-90/94) is only 3 minutes away.

If you’re going to be making weekly trips into Downtown and looking for convenience, driving will take anywhere from 45 minutes to 90 minutes depending on traffic. Although we offer free parking in a garage, taking the train into Downtown might be your best bet. From our place, it’s a nice 10-minute walk to Jefferson Park Station, then a 30-minute ride into the city.",True,True,False,False,,True,False,75.0,"[{'milestones': {'titles': ['<b>Jan 11, 3:00PM</b>', 'Check-in'], 'subtitles': [], 'type': 'check_in'}, 'localized_cancellation_policy_name': 'Strict', 'cancellation_policy_label': 'strict_14_with_grace_period', 'cancellation_policy_price_type': None, 'cancellation_policy_price_factor': 0.0, 'cancellation_policy_id': 44, 'book_it_module_tooltip': 'After that, cancel before 3:00PM on Jan 4 and get a 50% refund, minus the service fee.', 'subtitle': 'After that, cancel before 3:00PM on Jan 4 and get a 50% refund, minus the service fee.'}]",0.0,0.0,0,2020-01-11,2020-01-12,2019-12-28,2019-12-23 21:37:19+00:00,2018-07-31 18:08:23+00:00

Walk to nearby bars and restaurants, grocery stores, the 606 trail, coffee shops and beautiful parks. Come stay with us and enjoy all that Logan Square has to offer!

Garden unit with funky, urban appeal.  Slightly lower ceilings (about 7 1/2 feet), but you'll barely notice as it has a very spacious feel and FANTASTIC bright, natural light throughout the day.  We have a fully-stocked game shelf and a bookshelf with tons of great reads, plus a TV with Chromecast so you can watch shows from your Netflix/Amazon/Hulu/YouTube etc.  There is a very comfortable queen-sized bed, a futon couch, and a lovely chaise lounge (not pictured) for lounging.  Two bar stool chairs and a small dining table or sit at the kitchen bar to eat.  We have a fully-stocked kitchen with stove, refrigerator, microwave, toaster oven, coffee maker and plenty of pots and pans and cooking utensils, and you will have access to our grill for BBQing.  Feel free to relax in our yard - we have a deck with a large table and chairs and plenty of places to sit among the garden boxes boasting fresh veggies all summer long!

Guests will have access to the entire private apartment, plus our yard.

We are available by phone, text and email at any time.

We love our quiet, residential corner of Logan Square, especially because there are so many restaurants, bars, and shops within walking distance! Some of our favorites just within a few blocks are: Wyler Road (great craft beer and gourmet sandwiches), Weegees (speakeasy bar, with a shuffleboard table and outdoor garden), Ground Control (the BEST vegan/vegetarian food ever), Best Intentions (hip yet laid-back bar with a great cocktails, hip snacks, and a huge beer garden), Rico Fresh taqueria (small neighborhood taqueria tucked inside one of the grocery stores within walking distance - the huevos rancheros for breakfast are amazing if you can handle spicy!), Damn Fine Coffee (local roaster, great coffee and pastries), L'Patron tacos (there are no words to describe how much we love this place - unique, delicious tacos, etc), and so, so, so much more! Two great grocery stores within walking distance (Tony's and Rico Fresh), and tons more restaurants, bars, and one-of-a-kind shops just a 20 minute walk or 7 minute drive to the heart of Logan Square. If you need restaurant recommendations, just ask! We know lots of great places and can cater to whatever you're in the mood for. Also be sure to take a stroll through beautiful Palmer Square park. There's a 1/2 mile walking/jogging path and lots of shady trees to sit beneath and watch the city go by.

There are now 3 bedrooms, including a large mastersuite, on the upper level and 1 on the main level which serves as a multi-purpose room, including a guest room with 2 single beds when needed.  There is ample room/seating for 6 - 8 guests who can spread out in the 4 common areas.  Additionally, guests are welcome to use the outdoor space which brings added comfort and is good for outdoor dining, relaxing or small gatherings.

The apartment was completely renovated during the past year and is located on the first floor of a three story century old vintage brick building, locally known as a three flat. Redone in the style of a ""soft loft"" the unit has 10 foot ceilings, spiral duct work, newly refinished hardwood maple floors and an exposed brick wall in the kitchen. This bedroom is one of two in the apartment and has a queen size bed and a large walk in closet. The apartment is shared- at a maximum - with one other person. Each guest has their own bedroom. Each bedroom door has a keyed lock.

Marshall Square, adjacent to the better known Pilsen area, was settled and built largely by Czechs in the later part of the 19th  and early 20th century. Buildings are almost exclusively brick with attractive facades and are separated by narrow ""gangways"". While not one of Chicago's trendier areas, transportation links into the Loop are excellent, with a train station at the end of the block and less than a 20 minute ride to the Loop. The neighborhood is predominately Mexican now, with many excellent and inexpensive restaurants. Laguinitas Brewery and Pub is just a few blocks away as is Cinespace Movie Studio, where several network and cable tv shows are filmed.

Keyless entry.  The space is a completely separate apartment.  You will have your own private access to come and go from the space as you wish.

We live upstairs in our own separate apartment.  We can have as much or as little interaction with you as you would like.  Someone should be available at all times should you need assistance.

Andersonville was originally developed by Swiss immigrants.  In the 80s and 90s a population of gay and lesbian artists entered the area and the artistry remains today.   Lots of galleries and boutiques to walk to and be sure to visit The Women and Children First Bookstore!   Some of the best chefs in downtown open their second location right here on Clarke St.  But you can still enjoy good, cheap eats at Pauline's Diner just two blocks away, which has been serving food to local residents for decades!

Free parking is available on our street for those who may be renting a car.   In good weather, there are bus and train options within minutes walk of the house to take you anywhere in the city.   There are plenty of Lyft and Uber options nearly any time of day or night as well.

**We are only accepting guests that have been reviewed by other hosts.**  Please do not request to stay with us if you are brand new to AirBnB and do not yet have any reviews from other hosts.

The entire house was renovated - down to the studs - in 2015, and the kitchen is large and bright, and guests are welcome to use our refrigerator as needed. Guests are also welcome to use our microwave. We will provide coffee, tea, and set out simple breakfast choices in the morning.

Guests also have access to our upstairs workout room, which has a gym-quality Precor elliptical machine, as well as two yoga mats. If requested, you may also use our weight bench, and graduated Boflex weights, after a short tutorial.

Should you be traveling with smaller children, we have a full playroom with an art table and plenty of toys and dress-up items that your children are welcome to use.

We also have a spacious, quiet backyard for guests' use! In the summer, we have a dining table and chairs set up for outdoor meals or coffee (the table seats six adults). We also have plenty of outdoor toys, balls, and ride-on vehicles for children.

Guests have access to our Wi-Fi as well.

Should you need travel cribs, air mattresses, or a stroller, we are happy to provide them. We have a pack-and-play, a toddler mattress, several twin air mattresses, and a stroller - all available for your use. 

Finally, parking in front of the house is easy and free.","We offer a private bedroom and private full bath in our newly-renovated, 100-year-old home, on a quiet, residential street in charming Evanston! The bedroom sleeps two (or two adults and one child in a travel crib) and is attached via a private hallway to its own bath.

Our private room and full bath are situated off of a short private hallway on the first floor of the house. The hallway can be closed off from the rest of the floor. The room houses a cozy, comfortable full-sized bed that sleeps two adults, a full closet for your use, and extra pillows and blankets galore! A deep plum wall color, mahogany antique furniture, and artwork give the room a homey yet elegant feel. 

The bathroom features a full bathtub, with shower, and a vanity for any storage needs. We will provide plenty of soft, cozy towels for you.

We welcome children, and have a pack-and-play, and toddler or twin-sized air mattresses for your use. A travel crib or small air mattress fits next to the bed.

We will absolutely respect your needs when it comes to socializing with us. We are happy to leave you to your private time, and we also love to spend time with new people! Whatever your wish is for privacy, we will respect it. We are also happy to help with tips, suggestions and recommendations about things to do in Evanston and Chicago. 

We do have two children, ages five and seven, and I am home with them at different times during the day. We will not intrude on your private time. The children wake at 8am and go to bed at 7:30 pm, so there is always plenty of quiet, adult-only time around the house. Typically, the children are away from home from 9am until 12pm, and then often again in the afternoon.

Our house is located on a quiet, lovely, residential street, and is only a ten-minute walk to downtown Evanston, with its fantastic restaurants and shops! Guests can walk to bakeries, coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and several grocery stores (including Trader Joe's). We are also a twenty-minute walk from the lake, with its stunning lake shore path, beaches, parks and picnic areas! Take a leisurely bike ride, walk or run along the path, or take a swim in the lake in the summer. Visit the storied and beautiful Northwestern Campus, or grab a train or drive to downtown Chicago for shopping and sightseeing! You can walk to the Metra commuter train from our house, which takes you into Downtown Chicago in less than 30 minutes. You can also board the Purple Line, part of the Chicago Transit Authority's system of elevated trains, at the same location. It will also take you into Chicago. Or, it is an easy drive to downtown Chicago from our house. You will love Evanston and all it has to offer, as well as its proximity and easy access to Chicago!

The Art Institute, Museum Park, Mag Mile and Millennium Park are minutes away by train. 

Lakefront, beaches, stadiums, Hyde Park, University of Chicago, IIT, UIC and Loop campuses are nearby.

We offer a bedroom in a condo located in a hip, up-and-coming area near the Chicago Loop with parking, WiFi and washer/dryer access.

Enjoy the privacy/comfort of your own bedroom, a fully-equipped modern kitchen and full access to the dining/living rooms. Long-term stays are available. 

There'll be guests staying at our place during your stay which is great for meeting new people and networking. Essentially, we offer the convenience of a boutique hotel with the comforts of home. 

We're a mile away from the lakefront's bike trails, running paths, beaches and gardens, not to mention breathtaking scenery of waterfront skylines. Of course, we're conveniently situated for business travelers attending conventions at McCormick Place or meetings with major corporations downtown, as well as institutions of higher learning, such as IIT, UIC, Northwestern and the University of Chicago, both the downtown and Hyde Park campuses.

Getting around is easy as we're only a block away from the public transit stop. There, you can catch the train that'll take you directly downtown in minutes or you can transfer to other trains for connecting to all parts of the city, including both airports. 

If you have a car there is ample, free street parking and the Loop is only a 10 minute drive. In addition to the train, we highly recommend rideshare services from either Uber or Lyft, which are very economically priced from our place for getting around the city.

This is a great place for you if you'd like to be close to the energy of Chicago's vibrant Loop but want to experience a unique, local neighborhood.

Guests have complete access to our modern, fully-equipped kitchen so long as it's kept clean after each use.

Guests are provided city guides and public transit info via Acehopper, ""Airbnb's front desk concierge"", available for iPhone, iPad and Android devices, for tickets, guides and tips on local places to visit. 

When I’m around, I like to entertain. I’ll definitely make your stay a comfortable and memorable visit to the area.  Sometimes I’m busy, but I’ll do my best to accommodate your needs.

Experience the city like a true, native Chicagoan. Close to several parks and restaurants. Only a mile away from the beautiful Chicago Lakefront and Beaches! Plenty of trails for biking, walking and jogging. Enjoy water sports at the nearby harbor: 
* Jet skis
* Kayaks
* Flyboards
* Paddleboards 

Plus spectacular views of Chicago's magnificent skyline.

Nearest public transit is less than one block away, arriving every 5-10 minutes. Bike shares are available at the station. Just download Acehopper for iPhone and Android for public transit times, bike sharing availability and info for local events and attractions, including maps and tickets for purchase direct from your phone or tablet. Of course, we also recommend rideshare services such as Uber and Lyft to navigate around the city.","• Check-in is anytime after 3PM

There is a backyard with a small table covered by an umbrella, a fire pit and small grill available for your use.

Note: I travel often for work and some guests may find they have the place entirely to themselves (Except for my bedroom). I will set a higher rate for dates that I am completely absent from the apartment.

It is fit for a dream: a brand new full size plush mattress, bed spread and fresh towels furnish the private bedroom. A small TV is in the bedroom with Amazon Fire stick that allows you to access Netflix/iTunes/apps. You have sunny views of Holstein Park, and can see the signature skyscrapers John Hancock and Trump Tower from your bedroom on clear days/nights. If you prefer to sleep in, the wood blinds provide a ""blackout"" affect during the day, keeping your room cool and dim for daytime naps. There is a mirror over a writing desk serving as a dual space for your laptop or as a vanity. The bedroom door locks and you will be provided a key for entry.

I will be staying in the bedroom at the back end of the apartment off the kitchen (unless I am traveling myself) and will be available anytime that I am home, if not please reach me by phone.  On the weekdays I typically get up for work and get ready between 6:30am - 8:00am.  I will be out of the space for the majority of the day and try to stay out and active in the city during the summer weekends. There can be as much or as little interaction as you prefer, I really will leave it to the guests to interact at their own comfort.

Bucktown is an old Chicago neighborhood, the people that live here have pride in their homes, parks, and art fairs! It is a safe and quiet nook between the more bustling area of Wicker Park and hipster neighborhood Logan Square. You will find young couples, dog lovers and new families walking around the park. Some of the best restaurants in Chicago are located in Bucktown and are listed in the Guidebook.

Walking distance (4 blocks) to the Blue Line ""El"" access to both OHare International Airport and Downtown. Just a few blocks from the 90/94 highway exit and entrance ramps. Parking is plentiful, free and does not require a permit. A covered parking space in the garage can be made available upon request for an additional $5/night charge.  Uber is abundant and popular in the area.

Requests for a late check out will cost an additional $30 and must be arranged at least one week prior to your check in date. (This includes storing your luggage in the space until your departure). I will do my best to accommodate early check in if it is needed but I cannot promise it will be granted. I recommend you plan to arrive after the 4pm check in time. 

If you have an itinerary or specific schedule to adhere to, I'd like for you to share it with me so that I can make sure you are best accommodated to having the shower, and kitchen, etc. when you need it most. (Without me in the way!)","1. Remove shoes while in the apartment.

This listing is for bedroom 2 (queen bed) in a 5 bedroom apartment. Easy access to transportation, easy check in.

Chicago is a terrific place for all types of restaurants, great food, easy transportation.

10 min Uber/Lyft/bus/train rides in any direction will take you to Indian, Japanese, Ethiopian, Mexican and any other type of food you can think of.

Don't want to go to far? We have all of those great restaurants in our Albany Park neighborhood as our neighborhood is SUPER diverse and I absolutely love it.

You can easily get to our place by 81 Lawrence bus which takes you directly to the Jefferson Park Blue Line (easy access to O'Hare airport). You can also take a quick Brown Line train downtown from Kimball and see all types of touristy destinations our great city has to offer.

p.s. We're foodies and LOVE to give both places to go and restaurant recommendations.

All in all, this is by no means a five-star resort. What you will get is a family owned place, long-term tenants in the floor downstairs (we're upstairs!) and a family-environment with easy access so you can check-in quickly and go explore all that our great city has to offer. At the end of the night, come back to your room for a clean bed to sleep on!

Hello! 

We'd absolutely love to have you stay with us! We've been blessed in our short time to have travelers from all over the world stay with us from France, to Malaysia to the U.S. We've had casual travelers to people here on work trips.

The happiest stays guests have had here are the people that understand what we're offering. You're basically in a hostel / shared space. A very low priced room with a lock, on average from $18-$22 USD per night depending on demand, that gives you a simple place to sleep and amenities to use. It is our guests that understand that this is NOT the Hilton or Marriott that have enjoyed this extremely low priced stay. This is my parents home, and we come through and clean often but ultimately there's daily wear and tear as on any given day our five rooms can be occupied with around 1-2 people each that you might see in passing. Our bathrooms will often look used, our floors will often be scuffed, our kitchen will look like someone actually uses it because, well, our guests do, and you just might be having a pleasant meal and/or drink out with one of your short term roommates! The most unhappy guests are ones that come in with unrealistic expectations. 

We mop / clean every day, but (ESPECIALLY) the bathroom will always look used because we're constantly having guests come in and out of the unit and to be honest, you all have different levels of personal cleanliness and these are shared common areas amongst other guests. Other guests have had unrealistic expectations from one not liking the sheets because they weren't fluffy, to others being surprised to see us in the common areas because we're cleaning, to others just thinking this is going to be just like a nice hotel (completely disregarding the fact that it's a shared space) when it's not.

The point is, we'd absolutely love to have you. Prior to your booking, if you totally understand this and want an affordable, home-y place to stay that you recognize is not a spotless hotel, please proceed with booking. We absolutely love meeting our guests from all over the country (and world!) If you anticipate even just this message being a problem I ask you please cancel your booking and book a hotel downtown. You're coming into two 70+ year olds homes (that's Mom and Dad, we all live upstairs) and if you want the vibes and every day shared living of a place that's near transportation, halfway between O'Hare airport and downtown, then we would be more than willing to welcome you into our home.

Thank you and we hope to see you soon :)","Please wash your dishes after each use.

It's in an extremely safe part of the city and has very accessible public transportation. Being on the North side of the city, there are plenty of more affordable bars, restaurants, and attractions that I would love to recommend! Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions that you may have, I will answer promptly. :) I'll leave a flat iron, curling iron, and blow dryer for your use!  Btw the bed is super comfy!

Small studio apartment perfect for 2-3 people! I have a pull out single sofa bed and a full sized bed. The apartment building has a doorman which is a defining security feature. There is on-call maintenance 24-7 and the doorman will help with any questions that may arise during your stay.  

There is one bathroom and one kitchen. In terms of appliances, I have a small blender, a microwave, stove, oven, fridge, freezer, keurig, and toaster oven. I also have a kettle and everything that you may need dish/silverware-wise. Shower towels, toilet paper, paper towels, soap, shampoo and conditioner will all be supplied. The unit has heat, an air conditioner, and a space heater is available as well. 

Feel free to use my candles and essential oil diffuser to make things cozier :)

There is a CVS, ALDI, and Whole Foods near. There is a small well-stocked food-mart across the street.

There is a public gym with a pool attached to our building if you would like to purchase a pass. Its called ""Edgewater Athletic Club"" and you can email them for information about a pass. 



Laundry and trash shoot are at the end of my hallway. 

Check-in any time 11am-6pm (if you require a different time, we can likely work with you). My dad will meet you at the check-in time and provide the key fob (to get in the main entrance and up the elevator) and door key (to the apartment).

You'll be able to access the entire apartment minus one closet, but I have racks and bins to store your clothes. You'll have access to laundry down the hall. You'll have access to the gym with the purchase of a pass.

I will be in Europe and the Middle East this summer for academic purposes, but my dad will be available in the area as needed. Otherwise, I will have international cellphone service and respond to my calls, texts, and emails promptly if you have any questions. I am more than happy to help explaining the public transportation system in detail, suggest restaurants or night life, and more.

The neighborhood is extremely safe. It is a block away from Loyola University Chicago, so there is a ton of campus security in the area. There is also neighborhood watch and even a Loyola campus security building across the street from here. This apartment is also one block away from the Chicago Red Line which is the 'L' train. This is VERY convenient and I use it to get everywhere. It is also a couple blocks away from major bus stops. Right across the street from here is a highly rated Chicago cafe called Metropolis (I have spend many hours doing homework here). 

The restaurants here are super good and eclectic! I recommend the Ethiopian Diamond a few blocks away, Pete's Pizza on the corner of my street, Flaco's Tacos just under the 'L' train, and am willing to provide many other suggestions. 

Another wonderful thing about the location, its just a block away from Lake Michigan! Right on the lake there is a cafe called The Waterfront Cafe that has a great view and great food. There are plenty of lakefront paths in the area and the Edgewater Beach is very close as well.

Like I said, I am a block away from the Chicago Red Line ""Granville"" 'L' stop. 
This is the train line that runs North to South so the southbound train will take you straight to downtown without any transfers. It also takes you straight to Wrigley Field! 

Distances:
15 min. to Wrigley Field
30 min. to Water Tower Place
35 min. to Millennium Park
45 min. to Navy Pier
45 min. to the Sky Deck

Please let me know if you want information on the distances and directions to anywhere in the city and I can inform you of the best route!",,"I will be in Europe and the Middle East this summer for academic purposes, but my dad will be available in the area as needed. Otherwise, I will have international cellphone service and respond to my calls, texts, and emails promptly if you have any questions. I am more than happy to help explaining the public transportation system in detail, suggest restaurants or night life, and more.","The neighborhood is extremely safe. It is a block away from Loyola University Chicago, so there is a ton of campus security in the area. There is also neighborhood watch and even a Loyola campus security building across the street from here. This apartment is also one block away from the Chicago Red Line which is the 'L' train. This is VERY convenient and I use it to get everywhere. It is also a couple blocks away from major bus stops.

I have a pull out single sofa bed and a full sized bed. The apartment building has a doorman which is a defining security feature. There is on-call maintenance 24-7 and the doorman will help with any questions that may arise during your stay.  

There is one bathroom and one kitchen. In terms of appliances, I have a small blender, a microwave, stove, oven, fridge, freezer, keurig, and toaster oven. I also have a kettle and everything that you may need dish/silverware-wise. Shower towels, toilet paper, paper towels, soap, shampoo and conditioner will all be supplied. The unit has heat, an air conditioner, and a space heater is available as well. 

Feel free to use my candles and essential oil diffuser to make things cozier :)

There is a CVS, ALDI, and Whole Foods near. There is a small well-stocked food-mart across the street.

There is a public gym with a pool attached to our building if you would like to purchase a pass. Its called ""Edgewater Athletic Club"" and you can email them for information about a pass. 



Laundry and trash shoot are at the end of my hallway. 

Check-in any time 11am-6pm (if you require a different time, we can likely work with you). My dad will meet you at the check-in time and provide the key fob (to get in the main entrance and up the elevator) and door key (to the apartment).","My studio is cozy and has everything you need for your stay in Chicago! It's in an extremely safe part of the city and has very accessible public transportation. Being on the North side of the city, there are plenty of more affordable bars, restaurants, and attractions that I would love to recommend! Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions that you may have, I will answer promptly. :) I'll leave a flat iron, curling iron, and blow dryer for your use!

Stay for a couple days, or a couple weeks - you'll have everything you need no matter what! If you don't find it, just ask - we're right downstairs and happy to help!

This lovely vintage building has hardwood floors and exposed brick throughout, and the interior woodwork has never seen a drop of paint - it's absolutely stunning! The tastefully updated private unit where you'll stay offers a full kitchen with quartz countertops and stainless steel appliances including a microwave. A Keurig coffee maker and K-Cups are provided along with creamer for your morning wake-up with our compliments! The unit has a new heating/cooling system using ""Nest"" technology to keep you comfy no matter what the temperature outside! Three beautifully furnished bedrooms include two queen-sized beds and one full, and the livingroom has a queen-sized memory foam pull-out sofa. An additional Aerobed air mattress is available to place in the master bedroom or livingroom if needed to accommodate up to ten people.

The condo sits on a quiet, residential street, but it's just a half a block from Wrigley Field (and all of the fun and fanfare that comes with the area). Lake Michigan and Boystown are nearby as well, as are dozens of shops, restaurants, and taverns.

The nearest cross streets are Clark and Waveland, and the Addison ""El"" stop is just two blocks away. On game days and during events at Wrigley Field, the neighborhood gets very lively and pedestrian and vehicle traffic increases significantly! Getting in and out of the neighborhood in a vehicle can be a challenge during these times, so please plan accordingly. If you have any questions, about dates and times when activity will peak, don't hesitate to ask!

you're looking for a local experience. The neighborhood is Roscoe Village, which is a super cute (and not to mention quiet) neighborhood just west of Wrigleyville. Down Roscoe, you can find lots of shops, restaurants, and bars! We are only a 2 minute walk to Public Transit!

PLEASE READ, beautiful people: This is PRIVATE ROOM in a 2bed/1 bath, 1,200 square foot, 100 year old apartment where I live with my dog, Fonzi. The larger bedroom of the two; however, is all yours, fully equipped with a 3 drawer chest and closet to help make you feel more at home. The living room has a 40"" TV for you to use with over 60 channels to browse. The kitchen is quite large and is equipped with everything you may need. There's a little table in there for you to have your breakfast... OR if you prefer to eat breakfast on the deck, there is a large sectional sofa out there that is mighty comfy! I often sit out there with a cup of coffee and listen to the birds.

You will have keys to the front doors.

I will be available to help you maneuver your way around Chicago. I will also be happy to take you to a local coffee house in the area, if you're interested. I love to interact with travellers as I am a traveller myself. It is my honor to have you as a guest and I will do my best to make sure you have the best time in Chicago.

Roscoe Village has one of the best Chamber of Commerce groups in the city. They are always planning fun festivals and working to keep it a safe and active community. On Roscoe, there are a lot of locally owned shops - coffee houses, boutiques, restaurants, bars, and more! It's a very quaint neighborhood with a lot of tree lined streets.

The CTA is all over the place. If there's one thing about Chicago that I love, it's the ability to get anywhere you want on public transit. Bus routes are on nearly every block and the Brown line ""El"" is a 15 minute walk from here. We would also like to recommend Lyft or Uber (both phone apps) to use while you're in the city, if public transit isn't your thing. Your time here is valuable and these apps are great for getting you where you need to be, when you need to be there.

The apartment is located on the 2nd floor of a 3 flat building. Please be prepared to climb a flight of stairs during your stay here...

Unfortunately, I do not provide breakfast, but I do provide only the best coffee for my guests. Many guests have swooned over my coffee!","- Must love dogs!

"Disclaimer: please be aware that you are renting a historic 1930s home, not the Four Seasons.  Like all old homes, it has many ""charms"" and quirks.  Constantly renovating the home is a challenge, yet a passion, and this home is never at any given time in a ""perfect, luxurious condition.""  For example, the charming kitchen has 3 sinks, but 1 of them doesn't work and, so far, it has proven simply too cost-prohibitive to fix so you'll have to make do with only 2 working kitchens.  The kitchen has other charms, such as almost 75 cabinets and drawers, all from the 60s (and therefore, many of them tend to stick!)  Also, some of the bathrooms have a habit of leaking.  It seems that, we fix one, and then another starts to leak.  Moreover, given that we are a popular, almost constantly rented B&B, we are almost always in need of a ""paint job.""  No sooner do we complete a $5000 re-paint that it is in need of another one, so we can't guarantee a brand new paint condition; the walls and light switches therefore sometimes appear ""dirty."".  The furniture is extremely expensive and delicate European design and craftmanship and, therefore, the slightest sign of wear and tear will be readily evident.  Most of the bathrooms are renovated, and we did our best to preserve their ""high 50s"" look and feel.  Most of them have 100 little light bulbs -- so charming.  And the downside is that at any given time many of them will be out, and they run hot if you leave them on.  We just can't possibly keep them all working at the same time and often some of the sockets are empty when we are in between replacements.  The doors are old, and sometimes are sticky and please be advised that the lower level bedroom bathrooms do not have doors -- an intentional design by the famed architect Rebori and we have no intention of changing his design.  I would say that 19 out of 20 of our guests are delighted with the historically significant charm of the building and love its quirks, but 1 out of 20 is ""shocked"" to learn that we are not a modern, perfectly clean Four Seasons (where a 1-BR suite costs $850/night, plus the 20% hotel tax and, by the way, you'll need 3 or 4 of them for 10 people.)

Enjoy Chicago as “patrons of the arts” in the famous Florsheim Mansion for the Arts B&B in Chicago's Gold Coast at 1328 N. State Parkway. One of the most architecturally significant homes in Chicago, the Florsheim Mansion for the Arts is a perfect destination for families or groups.

The legendary residence was built by famous architect, Andrew Rebori in 1938 and was home to shoe heiress and sculptor, Lillian Florsheim, who purchased the place in 1946.  The famed house has been called one of the ""sexiest homes in Chicago"" by Chicago Magazine.  It is a significant landmark of the city.  Oozing with architectural brilliance, the home is 4500 square feet and is in the ideal gold coast location with 2 living rooms, a huge outdoor garden, and lots of open gathering spaces.

The historic residence actually has two houses: the Main House and the Guest House  which are connected together via the kitchen.  

The Main House has 3 BR/3B and a den (6 or 7 total beds), the Guest House has 2BR/2B (2 or 3 total beds), combined for a total of 5BR/5B.

The Main House entrance features a small guest bedroom with 2 full beds and full bath/shower, as well as a large den/office with fireplace and a pull-out queen size couch for 2.  Upstairs on the 2nd floor is a very large entertaining Living Room  and a formal Dining Room.  On the third floor is the Master Bedroom with king size bed (can be converted to two full beds) and full bath as well as another guest room with two full size beds (can be combined together) and full bath.

The Guest House features a small bedroom/bath on the 1st floor with 1 or 2 single beds.  The 2nd floor includes a massive Great Room/Art Studio with 20' soaring ceilings, large hearth, and a Media Room with flatscreen TV.  On the third floor is the Master Bedroom with queen size bed and full bath.

Combined, the Main House and Guest House can comfortably sleep 6-11 people.

In terms of entertaining, art events and concert performances, the Living Room with its Steinway Grand Piano can host 40-50 people and the Great Room/Art Studio + Media Room could easily fit a party of 15-20 more, ideal for conferences or large family gatherings.  An outdoor gathering could also be hosted in the Garden.  The Garden features a Zen-like Koi and Turtle Pond.  

In total, the Mansion is fully furnished with 5 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, high-tech media room, Great Room/Art Studio/Library, living room, dining room, and gardens. Over 5000 square feet of luxurious living space. Located on State Street you are just 2 blocks from the lake, 3 blocks from Michigan Avenue, and 2 blocks from the famous Rush/Division nightlife hub. Parking available and fully pet friendly.  Please feel free to visit the Florsheim Mansion's website.

The Florsheim Mansion for the Arts has long been an important art destination in Chicago.  The home is named after Lillian Florsheim, the shoe empire heiress who was one of the finest sculptors and gala host's of her day.  The home was previously owned by the Director of Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art.  In recent years the home has been used as an Artist in Residency destination for some of the world's most prestigious artists.  The home also hosts numerous philanthropic events focused especially on showcasing the art, culture and music of the Middle East and other areas of conflict around the world.  In a unique twist, artists are hosted at the mansion by benefactors from the other side of the conflict.  A portion of your vacation rental will be allocated towards these philanthropic activities, as well as the ongoing restoration of the home.

There is a wonderful video of the space on YouTube.  Since AirBnB doesn't allow web links, just type in the regular You Tube url, and then add the following next to it: /watch?v=MEWv8N7rNPo&feature=(URL HIDDEN)

There is a beautiful video of the space which can be found at www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQxhpeDzOEE&feature=youtu.be","Disclaimer: please be aware that you are renting a historic 1930s home, not the Four Seasons.  Like all old homes, it has many ""charms"" and quirks.  Constantly renovating the home is a challenge, yet a passion, and this home is never at any given time in a ""perfect, luxurious condition.""  For example, the charming kitchen has 3 sinks, but 1 of them doesn't work and, so far, it has proven simply too cost-prohibitive to fix so you'll have to make do with only 2 working kitchens.  The kitchen has other charms, such as almost 75 cabinets and drawers, all from the 60s (and therefore, many of them tend to stick!)  Also, some of the bathrooms have a habit of leaking.  It seems that, we fix one, and then another starts to leak.  Moreover, given that we are a popular, almost constantly rented B&B, we are almost always in need of a ""paint job.""  No sooner do we complete a $5000 re-paint that it is in need of another one, so we can't guarantee a brand new paint condition; the walls and light switches therefore sometimes appear ""dirty."".  The furniture is extremely expensive and delicate European design and craftmanship and, therefore, the slightest sign of wear and tear will be readily evident.  Most of the bathrooms are renovated, and we did our best to preserve their ""high 50s"" look and feel.  Most of them have 100 little light bulbs -- so charming.  And the downside is that at any given time many of them will be out, and they run hot if you leave them on.  We just can't possibly keep them all working at the same time and often some of the sockets are empty when we are in between replacements.  The doors are old, and sometimes are sticky and please be advised that the lower level bedroom bathrooms do not have doors -- an intentional design by the famed architect Rebori and we have no intention of changing his design.  I would say that 19 out of 20 of our guests are delighted with the historically significant charm of the building and love its quirks, but 1 out of 20 is ""shocked"" to learn that we are not a modern, perfectly clean Four Seasons (where a 1-BR suite costs $850/night, plus the 20% hotel tax and, by the way, you'll need 3 or 4 of them for 10 people.)  Thanks for understanding in advance and kindly only book this property if you are comfortable with these quirks.",,"The Gold Coast is unsurpassed in Chicago as THE neighborhood for shopping, dining, and walking.

Enjoy Chicago as “patrons of the arts” in the famous Florsheim Mansion for the Arts B&B in Chicago's Gold Coast at 1328 N. State Parkway. One of the most architecturally significant homes in Chicago, the Florsheim Mansion for the Arts is a perfect destination for families or groups.

The legendary residence was built by famous architect, Andrew Rebori in 1938 and was home to shoe heiress and sculptor, Lillian Florsheim, who purchased the place in 1946.  The famed house has been called one of the ""sexiest homes in Chicago"" by Chicago Magazine.  It is a significant landmark of the city.  Oozing with architectural brilliance, the home is 4500 square feet and is in the ideal gold coast location with 2 living rooms, a huge outdoor garden, and lots of open gathering spaces.

The historic residence actually has two houses: the Main House and the Guest House  which are connected together via the kitchen.  

The Main House has 3 BR/3B and a den (6 or 7 total beds), the Guest House has 2BR/2B (2 or 3 total beds), combined for a total of 5BR/5B.

The Main House entrance features a small guest bedroom with 2 full beds and full bath/shower, as well as a large den/office with fireplace and a pull-out queen size couch for 2.  Upstairs on the 2nd floor is a very large entertaining Living Room  and a formal Dining Room.  On the third floor is the Master Bedroom with king size bed (can be converted to two full beds) and full bath as well as another guest room with two full size beds (can be combined together) and full bath.

The Guest House features a small bedroom/bath on the 1st floor with 1 or 2 single beds.  The 2nd floor includes a massive Great Room/Art Studio with 20' soaring ceilings, large hearth, and a Media Room with flatscreen TV.  On the third floor is the Master Bedroom with queen size bed and full bath.

Combined, the Main House and Guest House can comfortably sleep 6-11 people.

In terms of entertaining, art events and concert performances, the Living Room with its Steinway Grand Piano can host 40-50 people and the Great Room/Art Studio + Media Room could easily fit a party of 15-20 more, ideal for conferences or large family gatherings.  An outdoor gathering could also be hosted in the Garden.  The Garden features a Zen-like Koi and Turtle Pond.  

In total, the Mansion is fully furnished with 5 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, high-tech media room, Great Room/Art Studio/Library, living room, dining room, and gardens. Over 5000 square feet of luxurious living space. Located on State Street you are just 2 blocks from the lake, 3 blocks from Michigan Avenue, and 2 blocks from the famous Rush/Division nightlife hub. Parking available and fully pet friendly.  Please feel free to visit the Florsheim Mansion's website.

The Florsheim Mansion for the Arts has long been an important art destination in Chicago.  The home is named after Lillian Florsheim, the shoe empire heiress who was one of the finest sculptors and gala host's of her day.  The home was previously owned by the Director of Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art.  In recent years the home has been used as an Artist in Residency destination for some of the world's most prestigious artists.  The home also hosts numerous philanthropic events focused especially on showcasing the art, culture and music of the Middle East and other areas of conflict around the world.  In a unique twist, artists are hosted at the mansion by benefactors from the other side of the conflict.  A portion of your vacation rental will be allocated towards these philanthropic activities, as well as the ongoing restoration of the home.

I grew up in New York and lived in Miami for 5 years before living in Chicago. In Mexico, they called places like Pilsen, ""lugares magicos"" or magical places. Pilsen celebrates Mexican culture in a modern world like no other neighborhood in Chicago. The art, the food, the local bars, and, most importantly, the sense of community makes this my favorite neighborhood in Chicago. 

There are various local coffee shops and bars to meet new people within walking distance such as the Jumping Bean and Step Down or Harbee's and Twisted Cantina,  hosting some of the best house DJ's in Chicago. 

You can find what I consider the best tacos in Chicago in Pilsen. For al pastor (pork) tacos, check out Atotonilco. For carnitas tacos, try Uruapan. Finally, for carne asada tacos, go to El Milagro. All of these restaurants are also within walking distance.

The room is private but you will share common areas ( kitchen , living room, and the bathroom/s) with other Airbnb guests.

The room has one full size bed. If you want to add 3rd or 4th guest in the reservation I could add 1 extra air mattress with no extra fee if the reservation is set for 3 or 4. If the reservation is for 2 and you’d like to have an extra air mattress we charge $15p/night and we provide air mattress and linens for it. the room will become smaller for luggage becase you will have two beds on it. This is a good option if you want to save even more money otherwise you can book two rooms! 
As most houses in United States this is not made with concrete so you will hear people walking or outside sounds. It doesn’t bother most of the guest but if you are a very light sleeper maybe you should choose an entire place. or have an earphone or something to block the sound.

You have wifi within the apartment but if you want to head over to Kusanya Cafe’ at 825 W. 69th St, and get to know some of the folks or get some work done, its a big part of our community.

Guest love the simi private entryway, only two apartments. There’s a small deck to sit and have a cup of coffee, glass of wine, read a book or listen to music when weather permits. The suite is a nice bright spacious living space.

The entire apartment is yours. This is your home away from home. Dishes, cook ware and other amenities are yours to use.

I love meeting and greeting my guest. Whenever possible I will be available to meet you upon arrival. No worries if that can’t happen. There is a key box for you to access key to suite.
Please know that I’m always a phone call or text away and available if needed.

The suite is one train ride away from White Sox Park, Soldier Field Bears Stadium, Michigan Ave, and Millennium Park,

It’s best to hop on train just across the street and go to many of the tourist areas in Chicago. Lyft and Uber are always a great way to get from one destination to another. 

There is free street parking in front of the building, sometimes difficult to park before 5pm because people park and take train to work. No problem after 5pm. There is parking on the lot on the west end of the property on a 1st come basis.","We ask that guest leave the suite in reasonable condition. 
Please:
-Let me know within an hour if 
  you have any concerns with your
   suite.
-put all trash in container or 
  bags in kitchen (bags provided)
-Please take trash out daily
-Put furniture back where it was
-Do not leave food out.
-Enjoy your stay :)

Old Irving Park is a historic, family neighborhood with quiet, tree-lined streets and friendly neighbors.  There are a number of local establishments (including 2 new breweries) within walking distance, as well as the obligatory Starbucks.
The neighborhood is really ideal for anyone flying in from O'Hare airport wanting quick access to downtown.

I walk fast and get to the Blue Line in 10 minutes.  For those who like to take their time, it may take 15 minutes.  If you time it right, you can catch the Irving Park bus and be at the Blue Line a lot quicker.   
There are 2 Metra rail lines within walking distance which can get you downtown in 12 minutes.  They are less frequent than the El, but run on a reliable schedule.
There is plenty of free parking on the street.  Nobody has ever had trouble parking.

People have mentioned the squeaky floors as a minor annoyance.","• Treat the property and our neighbors with respect. 

• Absolutely no smoking in the house.

• Try to be quiet after 9PM. 

• pets not allowed Security deposit will be surrendered in full if animals are brought in the home. 

• Laundry facilities are available on-site, but on a rotating weekly schedule that has some flexibility. Please coordinate access to the laundry facilities with host.

• Please leave the apartment in the shape that you found it. 

• Please shut any windows if there is a chance of rain as it can get inside and will require costly cleanup.

• Relax and enjoy!","I'm not always home, but feel free to call, email or text me at any time.","Old Irving Park is a historic, family neighborhood with quiet, tree-lined streets and friendly neighbors.

On weekends I'm usually out partying but I have been known to have a quiet night in from time to time. If you need a party liason for the weekend, contact me in advance and I will be happy to point you in the right direction.

I have a big kid job during the week so I'm usually pretty busy. You're more than welcome to come home hammered during the week, just don't break anything and try to keep it down while I'm sleeping.

If you're looking to have a quiet/tame experience in Chicago, I have a pretty good grasp on all of the touristy things to do and will happily point you in the right direction. Or if you're just looking for a place to crash and don't need any help/interaction from me, that's fine too.

The neighborhood is on Chicago's west side. There is a gyro restaurant across the street along with a convenience store. If you walk a block south towards Taylor St. There are a number of shops and restaurants. There's also a Pete's Fresh Market 4 blocks north if you intend to grocery shop & cook during your stay.

From a public transit standpoint, the place is ideally situated a block and a half away from the blue line and/or can easily catch the western bus. Uber and Lyft are also viable options and this particular part of the city is very drive-able with parking easy to find.

There is ample parking on the street and I do have a private garage space as well. The Garage only has one opener, however, so I will typically only offer the parking space during extenuating circumstances

The room you'll be staying in is my Green Room. Its main function is to host other touring DJ's when they are in town, however if the room is available on a weekend, it means that I am probably not throwing parties while you're staying here. If in doubt, inquire before booking. The listing says no smoking, however you can smoke on the back deck on the condition that you close the sliding door behind you and use the ashtrays outside for cigarette butts.

From a security standpoint: Generally speaking, neighborhood is relatively safe. I've lived here for 2 years and have hosted roughly 300 guests; none of whom have ever had any issues. The house uses smart locks, has a security system featuring intrusion detection and CCTV cameras facing the street outside as well in the the common areas of the unit (kitchen area, the DJ booth, and my office). While I do my best to keep the unit safe and secure, it is always advised to be vigilant in any urban area.

Also note: Freshly washed linens are changed between each guest and a cleaning service comes to deep clean once a week. With that said, I am a single male in my early 30's who lives in the space full time.

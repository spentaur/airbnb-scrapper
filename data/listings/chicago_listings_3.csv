bedrooms and front entrance will be locked,"Welcome to our sunny condo--a roomy, vintage space with a modern, artsy vibe--in lively,  lovely Oak Park. We are just 2 blocks from Forest Park's bustling shops and restaurants (try The Heritage for brunch!), and a 10 min walk to Metra, Green Line,  Blue Line (all a 30 min ride to downtown Chicago), and downtown Oak Park.  Located just off I-290, we have private parking and are a 2 minute drive to Whole Foods and lots of local shopping and restaurants in downtown Oak Park. Smoke free/pet free.

Located on the top/3rd floor of an early 1900's classic brick apartment building with private rear entrance. (Sorry, no elevator!)

Help yourself to a mug of tea and light breakfast in the morning in our sunny gathering space, or head out to one of many great brunch locations on the weekend.

The plant and light-filled condo is furnished with a clean, relaxing palette and a few of our hand-made tables and artworks throughout the home. 

The bedroom includes a twin size bed and twin size trundle bed. (Due to their different heights, they don't push together to make a queen size--sorry.) There are also 2 couches in different common spaces. A queen size double high air mattress (with a built-in pump that can inflate or deflate to whatever firmness you prefer) is available upon request. 

There are ceiling fans in each room and ac window units available from May to September. There is a laundromat located across the street. You'll find essentials such as shampoo (paraben and fragrance free, vegan), towels, sheets, cookware,  hair dryer, iron, first aid kit. 

We don't charge a big cleaning fee because we're counting on you to leave the place the way you found it. :)

one bedroom and all living space through the rear private entrance only; remaining bedrooms and front entrance will be locked

Great location to get away from the intensity of the Loop while still having quick access to downtown Chicago by car or public transportation. We are located on a side street near the border of Forest Park and Oak Park, a bustling commercial area. Oak Park is home to more Frank Lloyd Wright buildings than any other village, Earnest Hemingway's birthplace and museum,  lots of great community events, and tons of great shopping and dining. 

During the summer, check out World Music Thursdays from 5-9 on North Marion, free movie nights in Scoville Park, and the Oak Park Farmers Market  every Saturday morning at the corner of Lake and N Elmwood. 

During the winter, there is plenty of great shopping, holiday events, our massive public library, and $5 Movie Tuesdays at Lake Theatre.  

You'll find a wide variety of restaurants nearby including Thai, Mexican, Chinese, Israeli, Indian, Greek, Italian, bakeries, sushi, breweries, Chicago-style pizza, and more. Our favorite local spots are The Heritage (a quick walk) and Citrine for dinner, brunch, and cocktails and Spilt Milk for biscuits and breakfast, oh and pie. Our local food Co-Op, the Sugar Beet, is just a few blocks away. Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Target are a quick drive  and there are many great shops downtown including a fantastic book shop.

If you plan to take the Green Line into the city (my preference), I recommend a pit-stop at the Garfield Park Conservatory, a free and beautiful indoor garden space full of lush exotic plants, flowers, and even a few waterfalls. (Oak Park also has a small conservatory if you're looking for something in-town on a rainy day.) 

Also off the Green Line is the dining district of the West Loop (Morgan stop). For burger gurus, we recommend Au Cheval, though you might need to wait for a table. For veg and vegan options, we love Bad Hunter. Another popular spot in that area is The Girl and the Goat (reservations recommended) or their sister restaurant Little Goat Diner. For some cheap eats, Do Rite Donuts has great donuts including a few vegan and gluten free options, along with a smattering of tasty chicken sandwiches.

Heading downtown? Try a Chicago Architecture River Cruise or take the much cheaper Water Taxi for some sightseeing. Stop in for a bite or a drink at The Kitchen, right on the river. 

In addition to the famed Art Institute, check out the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, The Museum of Contemporary Photography (free!), and the Chicago Cultural Center (free!).

There is so much within a 1 to 15 minute walk from this apartment.  The Metra train (10 minute walk) and CTA Green Line or Blue Line train (10 minute walk) will take you into downtown Chicago in 25-30 minutes. The Metra station in the Loop (Ogilvie) has connections to Amtrak trains. Short uber/lyft ride from O'Hare and Midway airports (depending on traffic). There are a few Zip Cars a few blocks away if you just need a car for a few hours.

Overnight parking is not permitted in the village of Oak Park without a pass or permit, but we sometimes have private parking available. Please contact me if you are planning to bring a vehicle.

We are a pet-free place, not because we don't love furry friends, but because of our allergies to dogs and cats. We are a kid-free place because there are lots of plants, books, artwork, cabinets, outlets at kid level and a 3rd floor patio that we don't feel would be the best for kids.

Parking is tricky in Oak Park, but we sometimes have designated parking spaces available. Please let us know if you will be bringing a vehicle so we can help secure parking. If there is snow, you will need to shovel out your car. Shovels are available on deck for your use.

This is a third floor apartment with no elevator.

Because this is a vintage building with old pipes, there is sometimes a short bit of rusty water when you first turn on the tub faucet. 

There is no condo access to the thermostat.","- Please keep the place clean and tidy.

Get to experience what it really means to be a chicagoan. Enjoy the amazing food the city & the neighborhood have to offer. :)

Brand New, just upadated, Cozy 2 bdrm in Little Mexico. The rental is for an entire apartment. Living Room, Kitchen, 2 bedrooms and a small room with a desk.

This is for the entire apartment. :)

We love talking to our guests and we love showing them around town! We do have a very busy work schedule and are not always able to show people around town and sometimes we even come home exhausted and just wanna plummet unto our bed. Of course we understand travelers do feel that way too. We will of course greet you when you come in and show you where everything is!

Little Village is an amazing working class neighborhood filled with amazing people who come predominantly from Mexico. Needless to say, it is Chicago's ""Little Mexico"" and has a culture unto its own which makes it unique from all other Chicago neighborhoods and is especially different (positively so) from the Loop and Downtown areas. It's filled with families and you'll often see kids playing on the streets throughout the day. In the summer and fall it is vibrant with music festivals, community events, and big cultural ""Ferias"" that celebrate Mexican culture, history, food, and people.

26th Street is Little Village's economic center and it is a wonderful contrast to Downtown's ""Magnificent Mile."" Filled with mom and pop shops, bakeries, food, and beyond. It will transport you to Latin America. Take a day to walk down the 2 mile stretch of local businesses and make sure to make a few rest stops at the local bakeries, and taquerias.

We are close to main highways.

Train: The elevated (L) train pink line is less than a ten minute walk away and takes you to the center of downtown (loop) in about 20 minutes.

Bus: The 60 bus is a 24hr bus that runs through the length of the neighborhood's main street (26th st), then through the heart of Pilsen and gets you to Union Station and millennium park. This bus is a 1-2 minute walk from the house.

The 21 bus takes you through Cermak road all the way to McCormick convention place. It's a 3 minute walk from the house.

The 53 Pulaski bus takes you the north side neighborhoods of the city (Humboldt park, logan square, Albany Park) and is also a convenient way of getting to the train without walking. It's located on the corner of our block.

Bike: Chicago is a very bike-friendly city and we are bike crazies ourselves. We can provide you with a free bike map of the city if you need it.

Walk: take a day to walk down the length of 26th st. in Little Village. It's worth it.

Fly: the nearest airport is Midway (15 min. cab or car drive). Ohare international airport is about a 30min-1 hour drive away. Both airports are accessible by train and buses that can get you to our house in about 40minutes-1:30hours.

Swim: Lake Michigan is cold. Don't do that...",,We love talking to our guests and we love showing them around town!

everything but my private space

I stay in background but can answer questions if you have some. I can help you with public transportation. We have periodic house meetings.

Friendly African American neighborhood with plenty of walking space. People say hello here! Say hello back, or even first. This is a very urban environment.  This part of the neighborhood is friendly, people are nice, and things are o.k. even though not each house is picturesque. We have been located here 12 years without incidents. How many people can say that?! Neighbors know we are here, we teach their kids, we all look out for each other. We feel safe.

Just 2 blocks from here is pink line train- connects to everywhere and goes right downtown! Pete's Fresh Market is on Cermak (take #21 bus east) is not far, and has best and cheapest fresh produce. Lots of Mexican food restaurants one block away on Cermak. There is one Chinese Food place on Cermak walking distance. Can take #21 bus to Chinatown. Douglas Park is huge and has a track and outdoor swimming pool. Walking distance. Also has a lagoon. Plenty of fish and fowl. Can take pink line train downtown to many free and cultural stuff. Get off at Randolph and Cultural Center is right there- go in and check it out and go to visitors center too.

This room is on the third floor with private bath and will have a king-size bed with both seating and work areas. 
Out of respect for our neighbors and other guests, we lock the door at 11:30p unless special arrangements have been made in advance.
Dogs are fine with prior discussion, NO cats allowed due to allergies.

I am around most of the time and available to my guests at all times by phone or messaging. I enjoy chatting with guests, yet realize that it is unlikely that they came to stay to visit with me :-).
As a life-long resident of the area, I am happy to share my knowledge and to give recommendations.

Home is on a quiet, tree-lined street with a park just a block away. Many other historic homes and churches within walking distance. Lake Michigan is just 3/4 mile away with beaches, parks, and biking and walking paths. There are Trader Joes and Jewel/Osco stores approximately 1/4 mile from the house as is Hewn, an artisan bakery that guests rave about. Many fine restaurants  and unique boutiques are within walking distance. Approximately 1.25 miles from Northwestern University.

You can get to anywhere around Evanston and the city of Chicago from the Dempster Street purple line (2.5 blocks)and Davis Metra (5 blocks) stops which are within easy walking distance. Evanston has over 80 restaurants covering almost any ethnic food you could desire.

The bus route 250 which travels to and from O’Hare airport has a stop at the Davis St. (5 blocks). Ample free street parking is available on the blocks surrounding the house.","- No wet shoes in the house.

Our place is truly close to everything. Steps away from an L stop, world class dining & entertainment on Wells Street, Lincoln Park, and North Avenue beach. A 95 Walk Score!

This is a single floor unit with the absolute best location. It is less than a 2 minute walk from the Sedgwick Brown Line, which makes visiting the city quick and affordable.

The thing that I enjoy most about this location is the proximity to the restaurants and entertainment in Old Town. My favorite Italian restaurant in the city, Topo Gigio, is located on Wells Street. If Italian isn't your thing, there are many other very popular restaurants and bars located on Wells Street. Also, the world famous Second City Comedy Club is right down the street. Check out the people who got their start at Second City! I highly recommend checking out a show.

There is 1 oversized master bedroom with en suite full bathroom. There is also a twin bed, sofa bed, and 2 air mattresses in the den portion of the master bedroom. The second bedroom is simple but offers a queen bed as well. The second bathroom is located in the hallway, which makes it convenient for all guests to have access. There is also a full kitchen with barstool seating for 3, outdoor patio seating for 6, and a huge living room. There is a 46'' Samsung TV and a huge and comfortable couch.

Important Notes :

Please keep in mind this is not a vacant house - this is our part time home where we reside when not traveling for work. We always have the unit professionally cleaned prior to guests staying, and put our items away as best as we can. Definitely not a brand new property but it is clean, comfortable, and spacious. Probably not well suited for anyone looking for a 5 star luxury hotel.

Please be aware that we have a strict no party policy. While our house is able to host large groups, we expect you to treat this home respectfully and obey all house rules (no smoking, no excessive noise, no outside guests, and clean up after yourselves). We expect you to take the party to the bars and only use our place as a spot to hang out, cook, and sleep. There is another unit above us with full-time residents who work during the week and are very sensitive to noise. We will charge the appropriate amount after your stay if additional cleaning is required, evidence of smoking in the house is found, or damage is done to the house.

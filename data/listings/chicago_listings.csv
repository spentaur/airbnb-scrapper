One of Chicago's creative epicenters lies just outside downtown Chicago in Wicker Park and Bucktown.

The area has become a prevailing influence on Chicago's Michelin-rated, James Beard Award-winning dining scene, boasting some of the city's most sought after tables. Wicker Park and Bucktown are also known for their palate pleasing nightcaps, like renowned brewery Piece and mixology tour de force The Violet Hour.

“Experiment the adrenaline of the city from a quiet corner at one of the most representative suburbs, not too visited, vanished by a history not too often told, with locals whose daily train ride offers them someone to share their stories with. That mixture of police news at 8PM with beautiful street murals, electronic music mixed with men dancing in bus stops, mothers who bring their children to preschool mixed with gang members or basketball players, in short, the daily story of millions in the South Side, a side that left an imprint to the African-American heritage in the US, a heritage that is not too often found in books or tour guides, but that is felt and breathed in the air of the Gospel chants, the Mosque’s recites, and the streets of a city inside of a city, lost in a cloud of blurry eyes for those who have been in the ‘blocks’ for decades, with the contrast of a culture of diversity that rises from University of Chicago, the Museum of Science & Industry, the nearby bookstores, the first African American President, the birthplace of House music, the Black History Month, the teens who shoot photographs and listen to their local hip-hop artists, the speakers with basslines that deafen the small streets of this, our neighborhood. By the supermarkets you can see magazine covers announcing the return of those who once gave a name to Chicago, places, sport teams, celebrities who have walked these same sidewalks, faces full of makeup that remember a city that felt like home: the Chicago Bulls, Bears and White Sox, Michael Jordan, Oprah Winfrey, Steve Harvey, Laurence Tureaud (Mr. T), Buddy Guy, Nat King Cole, Muddy Waters, Herbie Hancock, Chaka Khan, Jennifer Hudson, Kel Mitchell, Jennifer Beals, Bernie Mac, Kanye West, Frankie Knuckles, Chance the Rapper, Common or R. Kelly come to mind. Nearby Jackson Park is Tiger Woods' projected golf conglomerate offering public basketball courts, football fields and golf courses. Historic Stony Island Avenue gave title to a 1978 movie that tells the story of the only white kid in the block that forms an R&B band. Mc Cormick Place is only minutes away; the largest convention center in North America. South Shore and the neighboring Hyde Park received national attention thanks to Barack and Michelle Obama's residence, who got married at the South Shore Cultural Center and gave lectures at the University of Chicago in Hyde Park. You can see my Airbnb Guidebook for more details about nearby transportation, groceries, restaurants, entertainment, nightlife, recreation and other points of interest in the South side: Soldier Field Stadium, Chinatown, Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Chicago State University (CSU), Adler Planetarium, Field Museum of Natural History, Wintrust Arena, Shedd Aquarium, Museum Campus, Northerly Island, Chicago Women's Park & Garden, Blues Heaven Foundation, or Buddy Guy's Legends, to name a few.”

Either the public transit, bike ride, car-share or drive to main attractions and the central business district is quite fast and convenient. 

Public Transit:
You'll find transit directions in most maps apps but here's a few of our favorite options to downtown and nearby attractions just steps away:
• Two Metra stations with two different lines; closest is Stony Island Metra Station which is just a 7-min walk from home and will have you in downtown in 23 minutes (Millennium Park), a ride that makes several stops at nearby attractions and features beautiful panoramic lake views arriving to Millennium Station.
• CTA Bus 28 (Northbound towards Hyde Park) is a 2-min walk from home and will have you at the Univ of Chicago, Hyde Park and nearby attractions on a 12-min ride; or during rush hours to downtown express in 20 to 30 minutes (Grant Park, Columbus Dr/11th, Loop). The bus also stops near the CTA “L” train at Roosevelt Station in Grant Park for the Red, Green and Orange lines.
Chicago's transit system ranks #4 of all major US cities, CTA trains/buses run every 15 minutes in average, while Metra train services run every 25 minutes during rush hours, or every hour at normal times. 

NOTE: Chicago Public Transit offers less frequencies during nighttime, weekends and holidays. There is almost NO public transit coming back home after 11PM.

Driving / Car-Share Services:
Our home is about a 15-min drive from downtown Chicago or the Midway Airport, and about a 38-min drive from O'Hare International Airport (without traffic). You can save on the O’Hare ride by taking the blue line to the city, then using an Uber, Lyft, a taxi ride or the Metra train from Millennium Station. Uber Pool and Lyft Line are widely available in Chicago; for a convenient fare you'll split with other riders you can get to/from downtown at a $12 fare approximately during normal times (not surge). Car-sharing and car rental apps like Turo, Zipcar and Getaround are easy to find and will get you a rental for the hour or the day. Enterprise Rent-A-Car is minutes from home at Stony Island Avenue.
If you prefer to use your own car, our place is conveniently located minutes away from the Chicago Skyway, the 94 and 90 Interstate Highways, and the State Route 41 (Lakeshore Drive).

Parking: 
There's usually plenty of free street parking (no permit required).

Bikes: 
Divvy Bike rentals are available only a few blocks from home and anywhere in the city, and you can pick-up and return the blue bikes anywhere there’s a Divvy station. Biking trails from here to downtown are abundant through the lakefront or the parks.

That mixture of police news at 8PM with beautiful street murals, electronic music mixed with men dancing in bus stops, mothers who bring their children to preschool mixed with gang members or basketball players, in short, the daily story of millions in the South Side, a side that left an imprint to the African-American heritage in the US, a heritage that is not too often found in books or tour guides, but that is felt and breathed in the air of the Gospel chants, the Mosque’s recites, and the streets of a city inside of a city, lost in a cloud of blurry eyes for those who have been in the ‘blocks’ for decades, with the contrast of a culture of diversity that rises from University of Chicago, the Museum of Science & Industry, the nearby bookstores, the first African American President, the birthplace of House music, the Black History Month, the teens who shoot photographs and listen to their local hip-hop artists, the speakers with basslines that deafen the small streets of this, our neighborhood. By the supermarkets you can see magazine covers announcing the return of those who once gave a name to Chicago, places, sport teams, celebrities who have walked these same sidewalks, faces full of makeup that remember a city that felt like home: the Chicago Bulls, Bears and White Sox, Michael Jordan, Oprah Winfrey, Steve Harvey, Laurence Tureaud (Mr. T), Buddy Guy, Nat King Cole, Muddy Waters, Herbie Hancock, Chaka Khan, Jennifer Hudson, Kel Mitchell, Jennifer Beals, Bernie Mac, Kanye West, Frankie Knuckles, Chance the Rapper, Common or R. Kelly come to mind. Nearby Jackson Park is Tiger Woods' projected golf conglomerate offering public basketball courts, football fields and golf courses. Historic Stony Island Avenue gave title to a 1978 movie that tells the story of the only white kid in the block that forms an R&B band. Mc Cormick Place is only minutes away; the largest convention center in North America. South Shore and the neighboring Hyde Park received national attention thanks to Barack and Michelle Obama's residence, who got married at the South Shore Cultural Center and gave lectures at the University of Chicago in Hyde Park. You can see my Airbnb Guidebook for more details about nearby transportation, groceries, restaurants, entertainment, nightlife, recreation and other points of interest in the South side: Soldier Field Stadium, Chinatown, Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Chicago State University (CSU), Adler Planetarium, Field Museum of Natural History, Wintrust Arena, Shedd Aquarium, Museum Campus, Northerly Island, Chicago Women's Park & Garden, Blues Heaven Foundation, or Buddy Guy's Legends, to name a few.”","A percentage of your payment is donated to Open Homes who help evacuees, relief workers and refugees find temporary housing, and work with some of the world’s leading nonprofits that connect people in need: International Rescue Committee, the Cancer Support Community, the All Hands and Hearts disaster relief for natural disasters, and Mercy Corps' global relief for natural disasters and crises.

Public Transit:
You'll find transit directions in most maps apps but here's a few of our favorite options to downtown and nearby attractions just steps away:
• Two Metra stations with two different lines; closest is Stony Island Metra Station which is just a 7-min walk from home and will have you in downtown in 23 minutes (Millennium Park), a ride that makes several stops at nearby attractions and features beautiful panoramic lake views arriving to Millennium Station.
• CTA Bus 28 (Northbound towards Hyde Park) is a 2-min walk from home and will have you at the Univ of Chicago, Hyde Park and nearby attractions on a 12-min ride; or during rush hours to downtown express in 20 to 30 minutes (Grant Park, Columbus Dr/11th, Loop). The bus also stops near the CTA “L” train at Roosevelt Station in Grant Park for the Red, Green and Orange lines.

Your choice completely! I am typically working at home doing a variety of random & artistic jobs. My roommate & I are very chill, easy going people. This is a drama free environment & it's beautiful. If you want to interact, come downstairs! Stay private... stay upstairs! Perfect!

Bucktown-WickerPark-Logan Square Neighborhood. I picked this area specifically to do AirBnB because it is safe, openminded, creative, up and coming, cool & so much more.  I have a huge backyard & there are several back decks that look over the neighborhood. You can see the Sears & Hancock from your entrance. Family oriented & steps away from city life.

One block to/from Western Blue Line (24hrs-direct to/from Ohare). One block from Armitage, Milwaukee & Western Buses (3). Street Parking Free, with exception of 1 day a month Street Cleaning (check signs). The 606 is one block away & divvy rentals are all over the place. Uber & Lyft everywhere. 

One stop North is California Blue Line. Super hipster art, bars, food & more. This area has a lot going on too, but the block from the bustle in a neighborhood setting is pretty awesome & relaxed. Wicker Park (Damen) Blue Line Stop is one stop South. Milwaukee is a very vibrant street and our location is in a perfect spot.

Boxer Boy & BlueTick Coonhound/Australian Cattle Dog Puppy live downstairs w. me. They sometimes go upstairs, but are kept out of the Air Bnb room,

We are 42o friendly. If that is an issue let me know. I want you to be comfortable! 

I talk a lot. LOL. I just do. Most people seem to enjoy it, but on my soul feel free to cut me off at anytime. I am NOT sensitive. I know a TON about the city, the cultures, the entertainment, the arts, the neighborhoods... It is the best city I know!

Living Room, 3 Bathrooms & Top Floor will always be 100% clean & open. Kitchen is accessible, but there is a possibility for mess as I cook A LOT. 

I will have cereal, yogurt, fruit & snacks and things. Help yourself. 

I have flexible check in/out. You can leave your belongings & use the shared spaces until midnight the day you check out. If I have a guest checking in that day I will need the private room available, with time for cleaning & changeover. So far this has been very easy, even with a 7am checkin and another 2pm checkout. Communication is key. 

If you need anything special let me know. Celebrating? Have a thematic purpose for your trip? I am a jack of all trades & party planning & design & hospitality are my jams. Happy to help you enhance your trip!","We are pretty relaxed. It is somewhat of a communal place. 420 friendly.

Family oriented & steps away from city life.","Boxer Boy & BlueTick Coonhound/Australian Cattle Dog Puppy live downstairs w. me. They sometimes go upstairs, but are kept out of the Air Bnb room,

We are 42o friendly. If that is an issue let me know. I want you to be comfortable! 

I talk a lot. LOL. I just do. Most people seem to enjoy it, but on my soul feel free to cut me off at anytime. I am NOT sensitive. I know a TON about the city, the cultures, the entertainment, the arts, the neighborhoods... It is the best city I know!

Living Room, 3 Bathrooms & Top Floor will always be 100% clean & open. Kitchen is accessible, but there is a possibility for mess as I cook A LOT. 

I will have cereal, yogurt, fruit & snacks and things. Help yourself. 

I have flexible check in/out. You can leave your belongings & use the shared spaces until midnight the day you check out. If I have a guest checking in that day I will need the private room available, with time for cleaning & changeover. So far this has been very easy, even with a 7am checkin and another 2pm checkout. Communication is key. 

If you need anything special let me know. Celebrating? Have a thematic purpose for your trip? I am a jack of all trades & party planning & design & hospitality are my jams. Happy to help you enhance your trip!","Spacious, sunny, art vibey, friendly & fun describe the bold characteristics, but it is completely your decision to engage with us or not! You have your own entrance & 2 adjacent restrooms on a floor shared with 1 other person.","Puppies & Privacy is exactly it!  Private Entrance/Deck/Room~just 4U. 420 friendly :-) includes snacks & goodies.

Gorgeous, sunny, comfY priVATE bdrm. 3rd flr-spectacular view! Lots of privacy w/ option to socialize. COME & GO AT ANY TIME.

This is a 30 minute drive or a 45 minute bus ride from downtown. The room is large and has a futon bunk bed, table with chairs and clothes rack. One person and several cats and dogs live in the house. The host is home at all times when guests are there, so communicating about schedules is important. The host is generally gone during the midday for work while guests are out in the city.

The guest bedroom is upstairs. There are only two rooms upstairs, the guest room and the cat room which has a couch and TV. The whole upstairs would be yours to use.

There is one bathroom for us to share. There is also a very large kitchen where you can store things in the fridge and use the microwave. There is a nice back deck and backyard that you are welcome to utilize. There is no washer and dryer for use in the building, but there is a laundromat just 2 blocks away.

Since we will be sharing space, I will be home at all times when guests are in my house. I do not give out a house key. We need to coordinate when you would expect to be at the house, so that I can make sure to be there for you. I am gone during the midday at work. Most guests are out of the house by around 10 or 11 am and return in the evening after 8pm. I am happy to hang out with you when possible to share ideas for your visit, but I'm also fine to leave you be if you prefer. Open communication about your schedule, before and during your visit, would be greatly appreciated.

The house is in the Belmont Cragin neighborhood of Chicago. It is a very residential street with lots of families and caring neighbors. I enjoy interacting with my neighbors so we can improve our community. It is a quiet street away from the hustle and bustle of the central part of the city, but close enough to get to all the fun city sites by car or public transit.

The house is two blocks away from the main bus lines of Cicero, Fullerton, Grand and Armitage. The house is a short walk from the Metra line, and one bus ride away from the blue, red or brown CTA lines. It takes about 30 minutes to get downtown by car and about 45 minutes by bus. Uber and Lyft are very popular and easy to utilize in Chicago.","I get up each day around 7 and work from home in the mornings. I get home from work on most nights around 7pm and go to bed around 11.  I would appreciate it if guests were in and quiet by midnight. There is no smoking in the house, but you are welcome to smoke on the back deck as long as you use an ashtray. You are free to store food in the fridge and warm things up in the microwave. There are disposable plates, cups, napkins and silverware in your room for your use. Please dispose of all food related trash in the trashcan by the kitchen to keep bugs out of your room. I would appreciate open communication about your schedule during your stay so I know when to expect you.","Since we will be sharing space, I will be home at all times when guests are in my house.

When planning your route, keep in mind that every 8 blocks equals 1 mile.

Chicago Public Transportation (CTA)
The buses and trains of the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) are a fast and cost-effective way to get into and around the city. Known as the “L” (though they may be elevated or underground) the trains are a fun way to see The Loop from a new vantage point.
CTA visitor passes offer the best value, with unlimited rides on all CTA trains and buses. A 1-day pass is $10, a 3-day pass is $20, and a 7-day pass is $28.
Passes are easy to use. They activate the first time you use them and are valid for the number of consecutive days purchased. Just dip your pass into the bus fare machine or the train station turnstile.
Check the CTA website for the latest fares, travel alerts, and trip planners.

Taxis
Taxis are abundant throughout most of Chicago so finding a cab is typically easy. Taxi rates depend on gas prices and number of passengers and can get a bit pricey but provide a fast and convenient way to get around the city, particularly beyond downtown.

Biking
If time and weather permit, consider renting a bike. Chicago’s lakefront boasts 26 uninterrupted miles of easy bike and walking trails.
Half-day rentals are available from Bike and Roll at Navy Pier and Millennium Park.


From the Airports

O’Hare International Airport: 
Chicago’s O’Hare is one of the world’s busiest airports. It’s about 15 miles northwest of the Loop in downtown Chicago. O’Hare has 5 terminals, all of which have information booths and multilingual employees to assist you.

Midway International Airport:
Although it’s smaller than O’Hare, Midway is closer to the Loop and services more discount airlines (but fewer airlines overall). If you’re looking for a good deal on plane tickets, check out flights to Midway.

Cloud Server – Throughout the entire house, I've setup a NAS (Network-attached storage). In my massive collection, I've about 12 TB's of movies, TV shows, cartoons, anime, documentaries, music, and such. You'll have access to all of this media upon connecting to my wi-fi.

【IMPORTANT】
For families or groups of three, PLEASE INQUIRE ABOUT PRICING. I am more than happy to accommodate 3 people into the room should you be staying with us. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU ASK ABOUT THIS SHOULD YOU WANT THE THIRD PERSON TO STAY WITH US, as we need to see how we can accommodate your +3.

Please note that for safety and security reasons there is a NEST indoor camera planted at the MAIN ENTRANCE of the house, right by the top window. As soon as you enter the house you will see it with a glowing green dot. This is to ensure people arrive on time, properly, and safe & sound.

The room is yours for the duration of the stay. Make yourselves at home; you're no stranger in this household. So asides from the room, you'll have access to things like... :

Washroom – The washroom is fully stocked with plentiful of towels, soap, first-aid kit, shampoos, lotions, perfumes, colognes, etc etc. If you need something specific there's a Walgreens within walking distance (5 minutes). There's also a Target and Wal-Mart within driving distance too.

Kitchen – Hungry? Thirsty? Aching to cook? Go for it! Our kitchen is fully stocked. You're more than welcome to store your food or edibles in the refrigerator. All we ask is that you clean up after you finish using whatever it is that you cooked or drank with. There's a dozen or so grocers nearby, so ask about them should you want to cook or fatten up., or want to some late-night snacks. 

Living Room – Guests are more than welcomed to lounge and chill in the living room. The living room is highly equipped for the perfect media experience.

IMPORTANT: I am abroad for work, so my folks will be taking care of your needs. We are very FLEXIBLE with check-in and check-out times. Depending on the schedule for our rooms, you can check-in/check-out earlier/later.  It is IMPORTANT that you communicate with us your arrival times so that we can make your experience/stay absolutely amazing. Please text my mom and myself or either of us, preferably both so that we're on top of our game to best make you feel at home.


IF YOU HAVE A PET, PLEASE LET ME KNOW BEFORE YOU BOOK WITH US. WE HAVE TO SEE IF ITS OKAY. OTHERWISE WE WILL DENY YOU ENTRY.


ALSO IMPORTANT:  We have three dogs on the floor you'll be staying. Sometimes they bark and sometimes they're loud, but it's nothing beyond our control. They easily get along with everyone. So if dogs are a bit of a problem, we will try out best to keep them at a distance. If you're allergic to dogs, then this our home might be a bit difficult for you. Please take that into consideration prior to booking with us. If you love dogs? Perfect! My dogs will absolutely love you!

Worried about safety? Not an issue! The neighborhood is relatively safe, so you don't have to worry about that gun violence/murders you hear media grossly exaggerated on the news. There are plentiful of grocers and supermarkets in case you feel like cooking -- cheaper and as good as a Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. Are you also worried about parking your car? Don't sweat it! This is an entirely blue-collar family neighborhood, so you'll see neighbors and folks out and about on the streets attending to their houses or chatting. Since most homes are family owned, you'll mostly see people outdoors chit-chatting away. There's also 2 parks nearby in case you feel like relaxing and enjoying some green; by green I mean nature-like feel... You can also go out for a job; some guests often jog around Midway Airport for some exercise. There's ton of Mexican food should you get hungry, and when I mean Mexican food, I'm talking about authentic real experience Mexican food just the way mama use to make it!

Midway Airport is literally within walking distance to our house. You can either walk it (15 minutes or less) or bus it ( 10 minutes #59 going west) or taxi/Uber it (3 minutes). The nearest CTA (public transportation) station, Midway Orange Line Station, is literally next door to the airport. The nearest bus stops are the:

* #59 - runs east and west of 59th Street (this bus can take you to the University of Chicago and is about a 30-minute commute). 
* #53A - runs north and south of Pulaski. 
* #63 - runs east and west of 63rd Street.

The Midway Orange Line Station is also a bus terminal and you'll have access to a variety of other bus routes that go everywhere. It is generally a 35-40 minute commute to downtown Chicago from the station. During rush hours, it is a 25-minute trip.

If your flight is arriving at Midway Airport, then this is by far the easiest and most convenient walk you'll have to take; odds are, you booked with us because it's so darn close to Midway, haha. Once you've landed and have picked up your luggage, head towards the train station exit that leads into the city. From there, you can walk east (away from the airport, towards the lake) on 59th Street until you reach South Tripp Avenue and walk until you reach our house. Or you can take the #59 CTA bus all the way to South Keeler Avenue (one block east of South Tripp) and then proceed to walk to our house. You can also taxi it as well if you’re feel lucky, but you’ll be charged about $20 and up for the convenience of arriving within 5 minutes. The taxi’s are located on the ground floor by the arrival area, just outside to where you pick up your luggage. UberX can't pick you up directly at the airport, but there is a loophole. Please inquire about should you decide you'd want to Uber it.

If you're arriving at O’Hare Airport, then you're in for a treat. Once you landed, picked up your luggage, follow the signs that lead into the city (via an underground passageway). You can purchase one of those Ventra cards from those Ventra kiosks’. Chicago has a warm way of welcoming tourists and visitors in the city by charging them $5.00 to board the CTA Blue Line into the city. You might as well purchase a 1‐day pass (3-day or 7-day depending on the length of your stay) for the convenience. Board the Blue Line towards the city and transfer trains at Clark/Lake stop. Make your way towards the elevated tracks and board the Orange Line going towards Midway. You will be getting off at the very last stop, which is Midway. The total time from O’Hare Airport to Midway Orange Line Station is roughly about an hour‐and‐a‐half. At the Orange Line Midway Airport stop, you can walk east (away from the airport, towards the lake) on 59th Street until you reach South Tripp Avenue and walk until you reach our house. Or you can take the #59 CTA bus all the way to South Keeler Avenue (one block east of South Tripp) and then proceed to walk to our house. Alternatively, you can also taxi if you just want to arrive quickly, but you’ll be charged about $40‐45. I highly advise against it too unless time is more important to you; keep in mind traffic is horrendous between 7‐9 a.m and 3‐6 p.m. An Uber will run you around the same price as well.

From Union Station, you walk east (towards the lake and crossing the river) of either Jackson or Adams, and walk until you reach Wells (a north/south street). You'll see sign for the Quincy/Wells CTA station. You’ll want to take the Orange Line going towards Midway Airport. This will be the platform that is on the east side of Wells. Take the Orange Line all the way to Midway Airport. Once you're at the Midway Airport station, you can walk east (away from the airport, towards the lake) on 59th Street until you reach South Tripp Avenue and walk until you reach our house. Or you can take the #59 CTA bus all the way to South Keeler Avenue (one block east of South Tripp) and then proceed to walk to our house. You can take a taxi, and that'll run you around $25. An UberX will run you around $20.

If you've arrived at the Greyhound Station on Harrison Street, walk to the Clinton Blue Line stop, and take the train going in the direction of Forest Park. Get off at the Clark/Lake stop and transfer to the Orange Line going to Midway Airport. Take the Orange Line all the way to Midway Airport. Once you're at the Midway Airport station, you can walk east (away from the airport, towards the lake) on 59th Street until you reach South Tripp Avenue and walk until you reach our house. Or you can take the #59 CTA bus all the way to South Keeler Avenue (one block east of South Tripp) and then proceed to walk to our house. You can take a taxi, and that'll run you around $25. An UberX will run you around $20.

If you're driving, then there's several routes:

【 I-55 (Steveson)】– get off at the Cicero ramp going south (towards Midway Airport) until you reach 59th Street. Make a left going eastward on 59th street. Make a right on Kildare going south, and then rely on your GPS to get to our house. 

【 I-90-94 (Dan Ryan - northbound)】– get off at the 59th Street ramp going westward (away from the lake). Go west on 59th until you reach (you'll get closer once you've passed Pulaski) Keeler. Make a left on Keeler and then rely on your GPS to find our home. 

【I-90/94 (Edens/Kennedy - southbound)】–drive south into the city and merge onto the I-55 (Steveson) expressway. Get off at the Pulaski ramp going southbound of Pulaski (on your left). Continue until you reach 61st Street and make a right, and use your GPS from here on. 

 【I-290 (Eisenhower)】– get off at the Cicero ramp going south (towards Midway Airport) until you reach 59th Street. Make a left going eastward on 59th street. Make a right on Kildare going south, and then rely on your GPS to get to our house.

NOTES: 
(1) REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY (see below)
(2) The host typically would like to greet the guests in person, occasionally this may not be possible.  In the latter case, please contact the host for the procedure of ""Self Check-in"". 
(3) Typically we can arrange 24-hour FREE street parking (just in the front or near the front of the house) for up to 30 days of stays.  It is the Guests' responsibility to do a simple registration with the village for street parking (Please ask the host for details). Street parking is pretty safe in this area as it is safe to begin with and the village polices are very  diligent in patrolling.  However if you still want a garage parking for some reasons, the cost is $6 per day and its availability is on the first come first serve basis.  The payment for Garage Parking needs to be made right after your booking for securing the garage space. If you stay in the house for more than one month, please discuss the parking matter with the host as part of your booking process.

REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY
Guests choose a place to stay based what it serves them the best.  We would like to highlight a few items worth considering and invite you to book this place.
(a) We run a very efficient operation and have a very competitive room rate with high quality rooms and services;
(b) This house has an exceptional great location.  It is about 7 minutes to Blue Line Austin Station by walking (hence very close to downtown Chicago) and has convenient access to west, north west, and south west of greater Chicagoland by car.
(c) Free parking up to a month can be easily arranged.  Parking can be very very expensive in any larger metropolitan, including downtown Chicago.  Therefore it is much more economical to park here and take the train to downtown Chicago. If you rent a room in or near downtown Chicago, you implicitly or explicitly spend a lot of money just on parking.
(d) The ""Occupancy Tax"" is about 11% here which is much less than 23% or higher (doubled) in Chicago. The occupancy tax is paid by the guests based on the sum of room rate and cleaning fee.  With this tax and parking cost in mind, it is much more economical (and without losing convenient access to downtown Chicago) to stay in a convenient suburbs rather than in Chicago or downtown Chicago. Since the ""Occupancy Tax"" is waived if you stay 31 days or longer, you can avoid this tax and save quite a bit of money if you plan your trip ahead and check with the host for room availability.

"1. You’re living like a local, be respectful of the other locals. We mean, c’mon, how would you feel if your neighbor wasn’t super awesome? 

2. All of our Rental Units are smoke-free environments. Even on the balcony, if you have one. We’re super sorry if this is a bummer, but it’s our policy. Hopefully we told you about it ahead of time and you aren’t super surprised that we still mean it. 

3. Pets are super awesome, but they aren’t allowed in our Rental Units. However, if your fur kiddo is a service animal then give us a call and we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your needs, as required by law.  

4. Your trip details should already be complete. If they aren’t, give us a call ASAP so we can rectify that! What’s a little information between friends?  

5. Your friend, your responsibility. Pretty simple, if you invite them to your Rental Unit, you’re responsible for their actions.  

6. While watching a million people get out of a clown car is hilarious, there are occupancy rules Stay Alfred must follow for each of our buildings. Help us follow the rules and check your rental contract for occupancy requirements. If you exceed it, don’t worry! Give us a call and we’ll get you one of our bigger travel apartments. (It’s like needing an Uber XL when you have a ton of people with you!) 

7. We’re here to help! The onsite building staff doesn’t work for Stay Alfred…strange, right? So, if you need something, send us a chat, or just give us a call. Our awesome Guest Services department will assist you 24/7.

heart of Chicago’s South Loop

These stylish South Loop travel apartments are the perfect home base for any trip to Chicago, whether you’re coming to town on business or for a vacation with the fam. Nestled between Chi-Town highlights like the Field Museum and sprawling Grant Park, every apartment features a spacious floor plan, a full kitchen with modern appliances, and essentials like cable TV and free, fast WiFi. The building certainly doesn’t skimp on the amenities either, with a resident lounge, business center, and a sunny rooftop deck with barbecue stations.

We believe in personal space. Prior to your arrival, your unit will be professionally cleaned and your self guided check in process ensures easy arrival with no long lines. Should you need us, we’re here 24/7 with our guest services team and local folks on the ground. And if you don’t need us, we’ll stay out of your way. After all, this is your place in the city.

Chicago’s South Loop neighborhood is home to some of the city’s top things to do and places to eat - with a more laid-back atmosphere than the hustling, bustling Magnificent Mile. In this hip district, you’ll find enormous, green parks like the Museum Campus and Northerly Island (not to mention Grant Park!) and streets that are a pedestrian’s dream with nice wide sidewalks. Cultural attractions abound, from the Field Museum to the Adler Planetarium to arts venues like the intimate M Lounge and storied Arie Crown Theater.

We furnish all of our properties to a uniform standard, but individual units may differ slightly from the pictures shown.","1. You’re living like a local, be respectful of the other locals. We mean, c’mon, how would you feel if your neighbor wasn’t super awesome? 

2. All of our Rental Units are smoke-free environments. Even on the balcony, if you have one. We’re super sorry if this is a bummer, but it’s our policy. Hopefully we told you about it ahead of time and you aren’t super surprised that we still mean it. 

3. Pets are super awesome, but they aren’t allowed in our Rental Units. However, if your fur kiddo is a service animal then give us a call and we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your needs, as required by law.  

4. Your trip details should already be complete. If they aren’t, give us a call ASAP so we can rectify that! What’s a little information between friends?  

5. Your friend, your responsibility. Pretty simple, if you invite them to your Rental Unit, you’re responsible for their actions.  

6. While watching a million people get out of a clown car is hilarious, there are occupancy rules Stay Alfred must follow for each of our buildings. Help us follow the rules and check your rental contract for occupancy requirements. If you exceed it, don’t worry! Give us a call and we’ll get you one of our bigger travel apartments. (It’s like needing an Uber XL when you have a ton of people with you!) 

7. We’re here to help! The onsite building staff doesn’t work for Stay Alfred…strange, right? So, if you need something, send us a chat, or just give us a call. Our awesome Guest Services department will assist you 24/7.

8. Take only memories, leave only the keys, fobs, parking passes, etc. behind. They won’t help you out when you get home and it’s a total pain to have to replace them. 

9. We love gifts, but the greatest gift is making sure you don’t leave anything behind. We suggest taking one last look around before you head home as fees are associated with sending you your belongings. Trust us, the extra five minutes is worth it! 

10. Ugh, here’s the hard one. Should you break anything, really mess something up, or decide to stay longer than your agreed upon length of stay, we have the right to charge you additional fees, but we’d really rather not (and, we’re sure you’d rather not too!)

Kitschy and cool, cozy and comfortable - a second floor private suite in a classic Chicago Victorian frame house on a quiet neighborhood street. A small apartment that's all yours. Dog friendly and no cleaning fee!

Located in the vibrant Logan Square/Bucktown/Wicker Park neighborhood, a hot spot of great dining, shopping and entertainment, I am renting the back half of the second floor of my Chicago Victorian frame house - a totally private small apartment suite! Built in 1889, renovated over the years with vintage and antique appeal, it has charm and style. You can also enjoy my lovely backyard - the perfect place to have morning coffee in summertime.

Accommodation includes a queen size bed, private bathroom with shower, a living space including wi-fi, Keurig coffee maker, microwave, and small fridge. Always outfit with fresh linens and towels, and roku. I will give you keys, and you can come and go as you wish, with access though the back yard and back door.

The suite includes a small, enclosed back porch area, perfect for morning coffee.
I have a small recording studio on the third floor, primarily used for mixing and mastering, with sporadic rehearsal/recording sessions. So you may hear some sweet tunes wafting down. 

Comfortable and stylish, walking distance from the Chicago Blue line (direct to O'Hare International Airport and downtown), and right off the Kennedy expressway (Fullerton exit, US 90/94) usually with ample free street parking. 

The suite has central heat and central air, which I happy to adjust for your comfort, as I control it from the front part of the apartment.
The suite has snacks and beverages, at no extra charge. The house doggie mascots, Stranger & Schnitzel, love company!

I am friendly and helpful, but I enjoy my privacy. I am available to help most of the time and I tend to respond quickly if I am not in a mid flight.

I love my neighborhood! I feel safe living here. I do advice to exercise some caution everywhere though Chicago, and this neighborhood is no exception. The Near West Side , one of the 77 community areas of Chicago, is on the West Side, west of the Chicago River and adjacent to the Loop and West Loop. The history of the Near West Side of Chicago includes the founding of Hull House, a prominent settlement house. The Great Chicago Fire started in the Near West Side. The area is home to the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), the United Center and the Illinois Medical District. It's not a very walkable neighborhood, but bigger streets such as Madison and Western are more interesting and safer to walk through.

My listings are very close to public transportation. The bus stop is right on the intersection and my house is 5th from a major intersection with 2 buses.  The way chicago works is that each bus goes in a straight line. Madison bus goes to downtown, loop, Sears (Willis) tower and Millennium Park, and Western bus goes to different neighborhoods such as Bucktown and Wicker Park and Medical District.  Blue line is about 8 minute walk, and Green Line is about a 10 minute walk. Both lines go to downtown, loop and blue line goes to the airport.  Also if you get Uber and use UberPool, it's only about $2.50-3$ to get around which is not that much different from public transportation prices ($2-$2.25), however Uber now changes their prices constantly so I find that sometimes its low prices, and sometimes its triple.

I will be an hour away.  In case of an emergency where you can't reach me, you can call:

Great neighborhood with quiet feel. Here are some of the details:

THE DAILY GRIND:
There are a couple small grocery stores within walking distance. Rich's Deli is an Eastern European grocery and deli - very cheap and delicious - about 1/2 mile away. Farmer's Pride Produce is just a little farther (3/4 mile). There's also a Mariano's 1.25 miles away.

Amazing coffee places (3) right on the corner.

GOING OUT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD:
My place is on the border of Ukrainian Village (which still has many Ukrainians and has an amazing Ukrainian art museum as well as a very beautiful Ukrainian Catholic Basilica) and Humboldt Park (which is Puerto Rican). It is quiet but has lots of unique restaurant and night life places. In terms of restaurants, you can get pierogis and other Eastern European food at a couple of nearby places. Also, just two blocks away is the Paseo Boricua, a 1/2 mile strip with the highest concentration of Puerto Rican restaurants in the country.

In terms of nightlife, on the closest corner (California and Augusta), for instance, there are four bars, including Dante's (beer and delicious pizza), Rootstock (great beer selection), California Clipper (which often has live music). A little farther away (about 4 blocks or a half mile) is the Empty Bottle, which is also a great venue in the city for live music, and some restaurants/bars. Despite all these options, the neighborhood feels low-key. It's sort of outside the main destinations for bar hopping (Wicker Park and Logan Square have busier strips- each are about 2 miles away).

Humboldt Park, which is a neighborhood but also an actual PARK, is 2 blocks away, and has tennis courts, etc. It's about 1 square mile.

TRANSPORTATION:
There is no walking option to the train. If you wanted to get to the Loop (Millennium Park, Grant Park, Art Institute, etc), you'd have to take the California bus (about 150 yards from my condo) 1.5 miles north to the Blue Line ""California"" stop. From there, it's about a 20-25 minute El ride downtown. There are also Divvy bikes a couple blocks away (a bike-share company).","No incense, please.

Back of the Yards is an industrial and residential neighborhood so named because it was near the former Union Stock Yards, which employed thousands of European immigrants in the early 20th century. Life in this neighborhood was explored in Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel The Jungle. The area was formerly part of the town of Lake until it was annexed by Chicago in 1889. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the area was occupied largely by Eastern European immigrants and their descendants, who were predominantly ethnic Bohemian, Moravian, and Slovak.[2]

In the 1930s the activist Saul Alinsky did community organizing in this area, as its people suffered during the Great Depression. This work led to his founding the Industrial Areas Foundation in 1940, which trained community organizers.[3]

Jane Jacobs in her 1961 book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, cites the Back of the Yards as an area able to ""unslum"" in the 1960s, due to a beneficial set of circumstances. This included a stabilized community base with skilled members who were willing to trade work to upgrade housing, as well as active and well-led local social and political organizations. Jacobs often cited the Back of the Yards as a model for other depressed neighborhoods to follow to upgrade their communities.[4]

Some time after the 1970s, when the stockyard operations closed and the number of nearby jobs decreased, many people left to move to newer housing and work in the suburbs. The population of the neighborhood gradually reflected a new wave of settlement, predominantly Mexican-American.

Free Parking in front on the street!
We have a rental fleet available if you would like to rent one of our cars! You must book a car in advance two weeks before your reservation starts. Cars run about $25 to $45 per day extra.

We are easy going and looking for easy going happy travelers. If you are not easy going and friendly please do not stay with us :)","I realize that there are many rules, I have created them to make it safe for all guests. PLEASE READ ALL RULES so that you have a good stay :)
1.(ALL GUESTS MUST HAVE A GOVERNMENT ISSUED ID BEFORE MAKING A RESERVATION WITH US FOR SECURITY REASONS) If your reservation is for (2 occupants) I will require full names of all occupants that will occupy my home. I may also request identification to be displayed at the time of check-in if I feel your Airbnb photo does not match your appearance for the safety of all guests staying in my home. (please make sure you have a new photo uploaded to Airbnb to prevent any inconveniences at your check-in date. If you have a friend staying with you at my home please plan to check-in with your friends or meet up with them later to get your friends / family keys that will be staying at my home.

(Yes, I have had guests attempt to sneak in friends at night and I feel that this is unsafe for me so for that reason I have added this rule and the fine for violating the rules.)
4. (NO PACKAGES / NO MAIL / NO DELIVERIES) We will not accept packages or your mail to our address. You may not use our address for any sort of deliveries. If you have lost luggage in flight I can provide you my office address for the airlines to drop off your things the next day.

I travel often so I use and trust a professional off-site management team to help guests get the information and service they need to make their stay enjoyable.

Everything you need is right outside your doorstep! Downtown Chicago is a city with an appetite—for food, of course, but also for design, history, and culture. Come here to marvel at the cutting-edge architecture or take in the gorgeous views of Lake Michigan; to spend a day cheering with baseball fans and a night laughing at a comedy show; to shop, to visit renowned institutions like the Field Museum, The Art Institute and the Adler Planetarium, and to experience the legendary blues scene. To do all this, you'll need nourishment: taste deep-dish pizza, piled-high hot dogs, Italian beef sandwiches, and more.

You are minutes away from bus and train stops.  

We find our guests prefer to use Uber, which is a very convenient and cheap way to get around the city. 

There is no parking available in the building, however there are several garages and lots within a block of the building.  We recommend the apps SpotHero or ParkWhiz to find and book parking.

You will be provided 1 set of keys to access the property.

Please be advised that all guests will be asked to sign a rental usage agreement that governs the terms of your stay.  For the protection of all parties, the booking party will also be required to provide a copy of a valid government issued ID and matching credit card prior to check in.

We strive to maintain the absolute highest standard of service on Airbnb.  However, we are not a 5-star hotel and are therefore unable to provide everything that you would expect from a hotel.  If you have specific things that you are very picky about, please discuss with us before booking.

Due to changing regulations on Airbnb in Chicago, we must ask that you maintain discretion with building staff.  Please do not approach them with any requests.  Definitely do not approach them to collect keys or “check-in.”

Please review the notes in the Location section of the listing before making your booking.

Once you arrive, we will ask you to follow our house rules.  

Please read these rules carefully and take them seriously.  Failure to comply will result in forfeiture of your deposit and termination of your reservation without a refund.

The Rogers Park area has been experiencing a lot of growth-from new housing to restaurants and shopping.  There are also a number of ""hole in the wall"" gems that have been in the area for a long time.  There's a little bit of everything in this area.

"House Rules
My house rules are fairly simple. Please remember that this is my home that I love and where I live and work.
I have keyless entry and will provide the code before you arrive.
Check in time is 1 pm. DO NOT CHECK IN BEFORE THAT TIME
If you are intending to check in after 8 pm, please let me know. 
Check out time is 11 AM

• Smoking is not permitted anywhere on the property.
• You are not allowed to enter other guests rooms.
• You are not allowed to bring guests into my house. Only people registered through AirBnB are allowed in the house.
• Please remove your shoes at the entrance and take them to your room. No walking with shoes in the home. Helps with noise control and cleanliness.  I have some little sickies at the entrance if you need them
Towels
There are towels in your room in the closet. Please hang them in the bathroom to dry after use.

Also, there are robes in your closet. Feel free to use if you wish. If you do use a robe, please leave it in the hamper in the bathroom when you check out, so I know to launder it. When you check out, please put the towels in the hamper in the bathroom.

There is a bottled water machine in the kitchen. You are welcome to use the machine to get cold water to drink while you are at home.  This is not for filling up water bottles for when you are out and about. (By the way, there is nothing wrong with the tap water, I just prefer bottled water to drink.)

Breakfast
I offer a self serve continental breakfast until 10 AM every morning.  (After that time, you must provide your own breakfast.)

There’s coffee and tea (make your own) for the morning.  In the mini fridge in the kitchen there’s yogurt, fruit, milk, half and half, and juice.   Also, there is always some kind of bread product—toast, mini muffins, mini bagels, English muffins—and toppings for them (jam, cream cheese, peanut butter.) Toaster oven is on the counter.

And there’s my homemade granola. And other cereals. Yay! Breakfast. Please enjoy.  

If you are vegan or lactose intolerant or are gluten intolerant, let me know. I have products for you, but them may not always be in the mini fridge.

Please rinse dishes and put in dishwasher if it is labeled dirty.  Or wash them in hot water and soap, rinse, and leave in the dish drainer. Please clean up after yourself.

Kitchen
The black mini fridge in the kitchen is for AirBnB guests. Please put any food items you need to store cold in it.

Please do not keep food in your room. There is space in the small fridge in the kitchen for food. If more space is needed, please ask me about that.

If you want to prepare your own food, please discuss with me.  The red pots and pans are for your use.  Talk with me about scheduling so we are not on top of each other.  PLEASE clean up well after yourself.

I do not provide cooking oil or condiments.  You may use my salt and pepper if you wish, but my cupboards and pantry are not at your disposal.

Food is only to be eaten in the kitchen or the dining room, or outside at picnic table, or at the bar in the living room.  Do not eat meals in your bedroom or in the living room.

Bathroom
Shower only house.
• As a courtesy to the other guests in the house, please limit your time in the bathroom as a consideration to others. 

• Please make sure that the shower curtain is closed well and the water does not get all over the floor and damage the wood work. Be conservative with the water. 

• Please remove your hair from the shower as a courtesy to other guest. No one likes to clean other people hair from the shower. :)

• Only toilet paper goes in the toilet. Not ladies pads or tampons, no dental floss, personal wipes, etc.

Leave the bathroom clean after yourself.  If you do ablutions, please clean up all water after yourself.

The Earth
I am concerned about one’s own carbon footprint and I try to be very conscious about use of resources and recycling.

Please turn out lights when not in use.  The TV, lights in the living room, dining room, and upstairs office are on timers. If you need to turn them off while they are on or on when they are off, do not operate the lamp—just use the on off switch on the timer.

If you are the last person in at night, please turn off porch light.

Please be conservative with water usage in the shower.

Please use the recycling bin in the kitchen.  Yes, you can rinse out your yogurt container and put it in the canister.  If you have a lot of recycling, please take it outdoors to the large recycling canisters by the garage.

Compost. There are always one or two compost containers next to the sink.  Please put fruit or vegetable matter in there, but no meat or chicken or cheese.  Yes, that means banana peels. If you have questions about that, please ask.

I only use cloth napkins and have lots of them, so please use them at breakfast and put any soiled napkins in the hampers either in the bathroom or on the back porch.
I appreciate your help with this.

Quiet Time
Weeknights quiet time- 10 pm - 9 am.
Weekends quiet time - 10 pm - 10 am ( headphones, low speaking voice etc.)

If you are coming back late at night from your outing, please whisper only and walk gently to your room. Thank you.

Have a great time in the Chicago area. Please ask for if you need for information about the city.

Bathroom shared with two other guest rooms. Quiet, safe, friendly residential neighborhood with easy access by public transportation to downtown Chicago (20+ minute CTA ride). It’s also very near the I-290 expressway. My building is near Loyola Med Center, and a 10-12 minute walk to the Forest Park Library.  LGBT friendly. Kitchenette available in this unit and full kitchen can be used in lower apartment.

Peaceful. Lovely. Quiet. Comfy.
I have a friendly cat who will want to say hi. But a warning--she lies. She is not being starved to death and you do not need to feed her. :) 
Sit down in the living room and flick on the TV if you like. Enjoy your favorite show, or a game.  I also have Chromecast so you can watch your Netflix favorites. 
This is a very comfortable quiet room with a big closet, dresser, desk and a full sized bed.  When you check in you will find slippers at the entrance for your use, and towels on your bed and  a robe in your closet for your use while you stay. In the bathroom, I have extra products and toothbrush, should you need them.

Happy to help make suggestions to make your stay in the Chicago area successful. I know the city pretty well, and enjoy hosting guests from all over the world.

Forest Park is right next to the more famous Oak Park (think Hemingway, Frank Lloyd Wright).  It doesn't have as many huge homes, but it is safe and neighborly. Actually, Forest Park has more restaurants and bars than neighboring Oak Park. It's also very near Loyola Medical Center.
There are a lot of different restaurants within walking distance from my home, and I'll provide you a list. There's also a grocery story and a gym withing a block or two.

Five blocks from a CTA station that will take you to downtown Chicago for $2.25. Also near the Metra commuter train. This is a convenient ride into the city and to McCormick Place, if you are attending a convention.
This is a few blocks from and exit from I-290 so it is easy to get in and out of the city.


Maps and binders with brochures of places to go and things to do.

I have a CAT. If you are allergic, this wouldn't be the place for you.  
On occasion, my kitchen is a catering kitchen, so wonderful smells will come wafting out.
Also, I work at home some and am around much of the time, and often have other guests, so this probably isn't the ideal place for a romantic getaway.

My house rules are fairly simple. Please remember that this is my home that I love and where I live and work.
I have keyless entry and will provide the code before you arrive.
Check in time is 1 pm. DO NOT CHECK IN BEFORE THAT TIME
If you are intending to check in after 8 pm, please let me know. 
Check out time is 11 AM

• Smoking is not permitted anywhere on the property.
• You are not allowed to enter other guests rooms.
• You are not allowed to bring guests into my house. Only people registered through AirBnB are allowed in the house.
• Please remove your shoes at the entrance and take them to your room. No walking with shoes in the home. Helps with noise control and cleanliness.  I have some little sickies at the entrance if you need them
Towels
There are towels in your room in the closet. Please hang them in the bathroom to dry after use.

Also, there are robes in your closet. Feel free to use if you wish. If you do use a robe, please leave it in the hamper in the bathroom when you check out, so I know to launder it. When you check out, please put the towels in the hamper in the bathroom.

There is a bottled water machine in the kitchen. You are welcome to use the machine to get cold water to drink while you are at home.  This is not for filling up water bottles for when you are out and about. (By the way, there is nothing wrong with the tap water, I just prefer bottled water to drink.)

Breakfast
I offer a self serve continental breakfast until 10 AM every morning.  (After that time, you must provide your own breakfast.)

There’s coffee and tea (make your own) for the morning.  In the mini fridge in the kitchen there’s yogurt, fruit, milk, half and half, and juice.   Also, there is always some kind of bread product—toast, mini muffins, mini bagels, English muffins—and toppings for them (jam, cream cheese, peanut butter.) Toaster oven is on the counter.

And there’s my homemade granola. And other cereals. Yay! Breakfast. Please enjoy.  

If you are vegan or lactose intolerant or are gluten intolerant, let me know. I have products for you, but them may not always be in the mini fridge.

Please rinse dishes and put in dishwasher if it is labeled dirty.  Or wash them in hot water and soap, rinse, and leave in the dish drainer. Please clean up after yourself.

Kitchen
The black mini fridge in the kitchen is for AirBnB guests. Please put any food items you need to store cold in it.

Please do not keep food in your room. There is space in the small fridge in the kitchen for food. If more space is needed, please ask me about that.

If you want to prepare your own food, please discuss with me.  The red pots and pans are for your use.  Talk with me about scheduling so we are not on top of each other.  PLEASE clean up well after yourself.

I do not provide cooking oil or condiments.  You may use my salt and pepper if you wish, but my cupboards and pantry are not at your disposal.

Food is only to be eaten in the kitchen or the dining room, or outside at picnic table, or at the bar in the living room.  Do not eat meals in your bedroom or in the living room.

Bathroom
Shower only house.
• As a courtesy to the other guests in the house, please limit your time in the bathroom as a consideration to others. 

• Please make sure that the shower curtain is closed well and the water does not get all over the floor and damage the wood work. Be conservative with the water. 

• Please remove your hair from the shower as a courtesy to other guest. No one likes to clean other people hair from the shower. :)

• Only toilet paper goes in the toilet. Not ladies pads or tampons, no dental floss, personal wipes, etc.

Leave the bathroom clean after yourself.  If you do ablutions, please clean up all water after yourself.

The Earth
I am concerned about one’s own carbon footprint and I try to be very conscious about use of resources and recycling.

Please turn out lights when not in use.  The TV, lights in the living room, dining room, and upstairs office are on timers. If you need to turn them off while they are on or on when they are off, do not operate the lamp—just use the on off switch on the timer.

If you are the last person in at night, please turn off porch light.

Please be conservative with water usage in the shower.

Please use the recycling bin in the kitchen.  Yes, you can rinse out your yogurt container and put it in the canister.  If you have a lot of recycling, please take it outdoors to the large recycling canisters by the garage.

Compost. There are always one or two compost containers next to the sink.  Please put fruit or vegetable matter in there, but no meat or chicken or cheese.  Yes, that means banana peels. If you have questions about that, please ask.

I only use cloth napkins and have lots of them, so please use them at breakfast and put any soiled napkins in the hampers either in the bathroom or on the back porch.
I appreciate your help with this.

Quiet Time
Weeknights quiet time- 10 pm - 9 am.
Weekends quiet time - 10 pm - 10 am ( headphones, low speaking voice etc.)

If you are coming back late at night from your outing, please whisper only and walk gently to your room. Thank you.

Have a great time in the Chicago area. Please ask for if you need for information about the city. I have baskets with maps and brochures in the rooms.","Happy to help make suggestions to make your stay in the Chicago area successful.

Steps from DePaul University, we're just blocks from Halsted/Armitage--with the cities best restaurants & boutique shops. If that isn't enough, we're footsteps from the CTA stations to get you anywhere in the city, and 2 miles away from the lake front! We'll provide the parking permit too!

While the home is 100 years old, the furniture is not! We have new beds, sofas, and rugs to give an old home a new look. Our 2 queen sized beds, sleeper sofa and an additional air mattress are all brand new, and we hope you find everything comfortable and relaxing after a fun fill day in the city!
The living area is open and airy. Our smart TV is equipped for Netflix for the days and/or nights you just want to stay in and get cozy on the sofa. Our kitchen is small but you won't feel left out, as it's open to the living room over the breakfast bar. Often times, we use it as a work space, but it's a great spot to sit and eat.
We've stocked the kitchen with local coffee and tea, creamers and sugar. The bathroom is clean and bright, no need to bring soap, body wash, shampoo, conditioner and/or towels--we'll provide those.

Guest access is easy, as the coach house is located in the back of the Chicago lot. The private entrance is through the gangway on the side of the main building. There's a keypad entry on the Blue Door.

Our team will be available if you need us by Airbnb message. We live in Chicago so if you ever need anything, we're am not far away. There's no need to wait around for us, as we'll have our own set of keys and key codes.

At the heart of Lincoln Park is DePaul University. It is surrounded by million dollar family homes, historic buildings, new construction, campus buildings, shopping and restaurants at every level: eat with the locals at Homeslice or Peaquods for pizza, State Bar and Grill, breakfast at Jam 'n Honey, and cupcakes from Molly's. If you're looking for fine dining, check out some of our favorites at Summer House Santa Monica, Blue Door Farmstand, Boka, Willow RM & Cafe Babareba. You'll find local stores and small boutiques for all your shopping and fashion needs.

Enjoy the short 15-20 walk to the Fullerton Beach or Lincoln Park Zoo! Don't forget to visit the Alfred Caldwell Lily Pond before you get there. Otherwise we're about 2 miles from the lake front beach and bike path, 4 miles from the Magnificent Mile (Michigan Ave.) 2 miles from Wrigley Field. There are also two CTA lines that will take you anywhere you want to go in the city, Fullerton Red/Brown line and the Armitage Brown/Purple Line.

If you don't bring a car, we are a few blocks from the Fullerton Brown/Purple Line train or Armitage. If you need the Red Line you can catch that at North and Halsted. Or you're a quick Uber or Divvy Bike ride away--we also have rentable scooters all around the city now.

Parking is free on the street in front of the home, until 6 PM. We'll provide permits to park overnight, for up to 2 vehicles.","We know, while you're on vacation, it's hard to comply with rules but please bare with us.

nights at 20% off OR 30+ at 25% off! 

The best of both worlds! Recently renovated two-story condo in Old Town with all modern amenities,  in a classic 19th century Chicago home in one of the oldest parts of the city. Ideal for traveling families and friends, and plenty of Chicago culture nearby, from nearly every era. A neighborhood bar with Frank Sinatra's favorite ribs! Michelin-starred restaurants! And only 20 minutes to the Loop on the train - book today!

When you enter - via private entrance - you walk up a set of stairs into an open living room / dining room / kitchen with soaring ceilings. Down a hallway are two bedrooms: one with a King-sized bed and an en-suite bathroom, and one with a Queen-sized bed. There's another full bathroom along the hallway as well, and the washer and dryer. Up a set of stairs from the living room is an additional bedroom with a Twin-sized bed. The couch in the living room functions as another Twin-sized bed.

You'll have full access to my entire two-story condo.

An incredibly popular neighborhood destination, largely because of its close proximity to the lake and downtown, Old Town keeps up a lively pace day and night. Victorian-era buildings, brick alleyways and narrow, tree-lined streets are charming backdrops to a busy main strip that runs along Wells Street between North Avenue and Division Street.

I'm a 5 minute walk to the Sedgwick Brown line stop, and just as close to the North Ave and Halsted bus lines - it's easy to get around town without a car from here! There's street parking in the neighborhood if you'll have a car with you, however.

I do NOT allow parties of any type.","- House Rules: Very simply, please respect my home and my neighbors. Please read these rules carefully and take them seriously, failure to comply will result in forfeiture of your deposit and/or termination of your reservation without a refund. 
 
1.) No parties or additional overnight guests without prior approval. Noise disturbances reported by neighbors or police are unacceptable. 
2.) Please ensure you have left the premises and returned any keys issued to you by the agreed upon check out time. Failure to do so will result in a $250 late check-out fee. 
3.) No smoking (of anything) inside the unit or on building premises. Additionally, Chicago law prohibits smoking within 15 feet of any building entrance. 
4.) Please be respectful of my neighbors and be mindful of noise and loud music. Please observe quiet hours from 10:00 PM-8:00 AM daily. 
5.) Pets are not allowed at the property.

Completely remodeled apartment.

Keyless entry.  The space is a completely separate apartment.  You will have your own private access to come and go from the space as you wish.

We live upstairs in our own separate apartment.  We can have as much or as little interaction with you as you would like.  Someone should be available at all times should you need assistance.

Andersonville was originally developed by Swiss immigrants.  In the 80s and 90s a population of gay and lesbian artists entered the area and the artistry remains today.   Lots of galleries and boutiques to walk to and be sure to visit The Women and Children First Bookstore!   Some of the best chefs in downtown open their second location right here on Clarke St.  But you can still enjoy good, cheap eats at Pauline's Diner just two blocks away, which has been serving food to local residents for decades!

Free parking is available on our street for those who may be renting a car.   In good weather, there are bus and train options within minutes walk of the house to take you anywhere in the city.   There are plenty of Lyft and Uber options nearly any time of day or night as well.

**We are only accepting guests that have been reviewed by other hosts.**  Please do not request to stay with us if you are brand new to AirBnB and do not yet have any reviews from other hosts.  Unfortunately we have been burned in the past and now we use this review system to confirm that guests are who they say they are.

You are welcome to use the spacious kitchen and the laundry room as well.

The house was built in 1977.  I bought it in 2013.  The previous owners were elderly and did not keep up the maintenance and decor, so I'm been busy redecorating and spending a lot of money in the process.  

Since the house is a ranch built on a concrete slab, there are no pesky stairs to climb and no creaky floors.  The guest bedroom is located in the rear of the house, which faces a very wooded and private area beyond the backyard.

You will have access to the guest bedroom which contains a full-sized bed, the main bathroom, laundry room and the kitchen.  I usually have a fresh pot of coffee made in the morning.

I will be available to offer help during your stay.

Mill Pond Park is an easy walk down the street.  The back of my house butts up the tapered end of the north-south leg of the park.

The neighborhood is a very friendly melting pot of many ages, nationalities and races.  Most neighbors seem to be ""empty nesters"", but I've noticed the trend is for young families to be moving in lately.

For shopping and restaurants, take Mill Pond Drive west, then Schmale north to Army Trail Road west.  You will drive by many popular restaurants including Friday's, Olive Garden and Chili's.  Drive a little farther west and turn right (north) on Springfield Dr. if you'd like to visit Stratford Square Mall.

If you'd like to take public transportation to the City (Chicago), I would suggest the Metra commuter train.  My house is about 24 miles West of downtown Chicago, and equidistant between two suburban train stations: Wheaton and Roselle (about a 10-minute drive to each station).  The Wheaton Metra train will take you to Ogilvie Train Station, and the Roselle Metra train will take you to Union Station.

Just about every type of retail store and restaurant imaginable are located within a 2-mile radius.  Stratford Square Mall is about 1.5 miles away.  Historic downtown Wheaton is about a 10-minute drive south.","- No shoes in house as most of the space is wall-to-wall carpeting.
- Two adult guests maximum please, as I have no additional bedding for additional guests.  If you have a baby or small child, you must provide crib/bedding.",I will be available to offer help during your stay.,"Mill Pond Park is an easy walk down the street.  The back of my house butts up the tapered end of the north-south leg of the park.

The neighborhood is a very friendly melting pot of many ages, nationalities and races.  Most neighbors seem to be ""empty nesters"", but I've noticed the trend is for young families to be moving in lately.

For shopping and restaurants, take Mill Pond Drive west, then Schmale north to Army Trail Road west.  You will drive by many popular restaurants including Friday's, Olive Garden and Chili's.  Drive a little farther west and turn right (north) on Springfield Dr. if you'd like to visit Stratford Square Mall.",Just about every type of retail store and restaurant imaginable are located within a 2-mile radius.  Stratford Square Mall is about 1.5 miles away.  Historic downtown Wheaton is about a 10-minute drive south.,"The house was built in 1977.  I bought it in 2013.  The previous owners were elderly and did not keep up the maintenance and decor, so I'm been busy redecorating and spending a lot of money in the process.  

Since the house is a ranch built on a concrete slab, there are no pesky stairs to climb and no creaky floors.  The guest bedroom is located in the rear of the house, which faces a very wooded and private area beyond the backyard.","I'm still in the process of decorating, but so far, the look is a blend of modern, farmhouse and nautical.  You are welcome to use the spacious kitchen and the laundry room as well.","If you'd like to take public transportation to the City (Chicago), I would suggest the Metra commuter train.

Downtown isn't far either!

The entire room is yours to use! Just be respectful and sanitary of the room -- common sense! As you can see, the room is highly decorated with an assorted and variety of posters. You'll have access an enormous bedroom that was furnished for the purpose of a media/entertainment center, then purposed with a full-size bed. This room is ideal for watching TV, movies, listening to music, etc. You can hook up your own laptop to the 42"" LCD TV via HDMI or VGA. Alternatively, you can also hook up your device via a bluetooth adapter. My home theater system easily connects to any smartphone device with bluetooth capabilities. So you won't have to worry about hooking up cords if you're listening to music via your phone/ipad/kindle/etc etc. I've also a Roku 3 attached to the TV; so you can stream content from your device onto the TV, stream media from my massive cloud server (12 TB's), or watch videos on native apps like Netflix or Hulu via the Roku 3. It's also got an auxiliary (earphones or headphones plug) connection, so that you can binge watch your favorite show without disturbing others at night. Or if you're too ashamed to openly watch My Little Pony, then you can watch it at your discretion. Can't sleep? Watch a movie! Don't feel like leaving the house, and want to cook, why not blast some music!? There are speakers in every corner of the room. You can even feel the slightest vibration emitting from the walls even at mid-volume. You've got a walk-in closet as well, so feel free to unpack as if you've arrived home for the holidays.

【IMPORTANT】
For families or groups of three, PLEASE INQUIRE ABOUT PRICING. I am more than happy to accommodate 3 people into the room should you be staying with us. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU ASK ABOUT THIS SHOULD YOU WANT THE THIRD PERSON TO STAY WITH US, as we need to see how we can accommodate your +3.

Please note that for safety and security reasons there is a NEST indoor camera planted at the MAIN ENTRANCE of the house, right by the top window. As soon as you enter the house you will see it with a glowing green dot. This is to ensure people arrive on time, properly, and safe & sound.

The room is yours for the duration of the stay. Make yourselves at home; you're no stranger in this household. So asides from the room, you'll have access to things like... :

Washroom – The washroom is fully stocked with plentiful of towels, soap, first-aid kit, shampoos, lotions, perfumes, colognes, etc etc. If you need something specific there's a Walgreens within walking distance (5 minutes). There's also a Target and Wal-Mart within driving distance too.

IMPORTANT: I am abroad for work, so my folks will be taking care of your needs. We are very FLEXIBLE with check-in and check-out times. Depending on the schedule for our rooms, you can check-in/check-out earlier/later.  It is IMPORTANT that you communicate with us your arrival times so that we can make your experience/stay absolutely amazing. Please text my mom and myself or either of us, preferably both so that we're on top of our game to best make you feel at home.


IF YOU HAVE A PET, PLEASE LET ME KNOW BEFORE YOU BOOK WITH US. WE HAVE TO SEE IF ITS OKAY. OTHERWISE WE WILL DENY YOU ENTRY.


ALSO IMPORTANT:  We have three dogs on the floor you'll be staying. Sometimes they bark and sometimes they're loud, but it's nothing beyond our control. They easily get along with everyone. So if dogs are a bit of a problem, we will try out best to keep them at a distance. If you're allergic to dogs, then this our home might be a bit difficult for you. Please take that into consideration prior to booking with us. If you love dogs? Perfect! My dogs will absolutely love you!

Worried about safety? Not an issue! The neighborhood is relatively safe, so you don't have to worry about that gun violence/murders you hear media grossly exaggerated on the news. There are plentiful of grocers and supermarkets in case you feel like cooking -- cheaper and as good as a Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. Are you also worried about parking your car? Don't sweat it! This is an entirely blue-collar family neighborhood, so you'll see neighbors and folks out and about on the streets attending to their houses or chatting. Since most homes are family owned, you'll mostly see people outdoors chit-chatting away. There's also 2 parks nearby in case you feel like relaxing and enjoying some green; by green I mean nature-like feel... You can also go out for a job; some guests often jog around Midway Airport for some exercise. There's ton of Mexican food should you get hungry, and when I mean Mexican food, I'm talking about authentic real experience Mexican food just the way mama use to make it!

Midway Airport is literally within walking distance to our house. You can either walk it (15 minutes or less) or bus it ( 10 minutes #59 going west) or taxi/Uber it (3 minutes). The nearest CTA (public transportation) station, Midway Orange Line Station, is literally next door to the airport. The nearest bus stops are the:

* #59 - runs east and west of 59th Street (this bus can take you to the University of Chicago and is about a 30-minute commute). 
* #53A - runs north and south of Pulaski. 
* #63 - runs east and west of 63rd Street.

The Midway Orange Line Station is also a bus terminal and you'll have access to a variety of other bus routes that go everywhere. It is generally a 35-40 minute commute to downtown Chicago from the station. During rush hours, it is a 25-minute trip.

If your flight is arriving at Midway Airport, then this is by far the easiest and most convenient walk you'll have to take; odds are, you booked with us because it's so darn close to Midway, haha. Once you've landed and have picked up your luggage, head towards the train station exit that leads into the city. From there, you can walk east (away from the airport, towards the lake) on 59th Street until you reach South Tripp Avenue and walk until you reach our house. Or you can take the #59 CTA bus all the way to South Keeler Avenue (one block east of South Tripp) and then proceed to walk to our house. You can also taxi it as well if you’re feel lucky, but you’ll be charged about $20 and up for the convenience of arriving within 5 minutes. The taxi’s are located on the ground floor by the arrival area, just outside to where you pick up your luggage. UberX can't pick you up directly at the airport, but there is a loophole. Please inquire about should you decide you'd want to Uber it.

If you're arriving at O’Hare Airport, then you're in for a treat. Once you landed, picked up your luggage, follow the signs that lead into the city (via an underground passageway). You can purchase one of those Ventra cards from those Ventra kiosks’. Chicago has a warm way of welcoming tourists and visitors in the city by charging them $5.00 to board the CTA Blue Line into the city. You might as well purchase a 1‐day pass (3-day or 7-day depending on the length of your stay) for the convenience. Board the Blue Line towards the city and transfer trains at Clark/Lake stop. Make your way towards the elevated tracks and board the Orange Line going towards Midway. You will be getting off at the very last stop, which is Midway. The total time from O’Hare Airport to Midway Orange Line Station is roughly about an hour‐and‐a‐half. At the Orange Line Midway Airport stop, you can walk east (away from the airport, towards the lake) on 59th Street until you reach South Tripp Avenue and walk until you reach our house. Or you can take the #59 CTA bus all the way to South Keeler Avenue (one block east of South Tripp) and then proceed to walk to our house. Alternatively, you can also taxi if you just want to arrive quickly, but you’ll be charged about $40‐45. I highly advise against it too unless time is more important to you; keep in mind traffic is horrendous between 7‐9 a.m and 3‐6 p.m. An Uber will run you around the same price as well.

From Union Station, you walk east (towards the lake and crossing the river) of either Jackson or Adams, and walk until you reach Wells (a north/south street). You'll see sign for the Quincy/Wells CTA station. You’ll want to take the Orange Line going towards Midway Airport. This will be the platform that is on the east side of Wells. Take the Orange Line all the way to Midway Airport. Once you're at the Midway Airport station, you can walk east (away from the airport, towards the lake) on 59th Street until you reach South Tripp Avenue and walk until you reach our house. Or you can take the #59 CTA bus all the way to South Keeler Avenue (one block east of South Tripp) and then proceed to walk to our house. You can take a taxi, and that'll run you around $25. An UberX will run you around $20.

If you've arrived at the Greyhound Station on Harrison Street, walk to the Clinton Blue Line stop, and take the train going in the direction of Forest Park. Get off at the Clark/Lake stop and transfer to the Orange Line going to Midway Airport. Take the Orange Line all the way to Midway Airport. Once you're at the Midway Airport station, you can walk east (away from the airport, towards the lake) on 59th Street until you reach South Tripp Avenue and walk until you reach our house. Or you can take the #59 CTA bus all the way to South Keeler Avenue (one block east of South Tripp) and then proceed to walk to our house. You can take a taxi, and that'll run you around $25. An UberX will run you around $20.

If you're driving, then there's several routes:

【 I-55 (Steveson)】– get off at the Cicero ramp going south (towards Midway Airport) until you reach 59th Street. Make a left going eastward on 59th street. Make a right on Kildare going south, and then rely on your GPS to get to our house. 

【 I-90-94 (Dan Ryan - northbound)】– get off at the 59th Street ramp going westward (away from the lake). Go west on 59th until you reach (you'll get closer once you've passed Pulaski) Keeler. Make a left on Keeler and then rely on your GPS to find our home. 

【I-90/94 (Edens/Kennedy - southbound)】–drive south into the city and merge onto the I-55 (Steveson) expressway. Get off at the Pulaski ramp going southbound of Pulaski (on your left). Continue until you reach 61st Street and make a right, and use your GPS from here on. 

 【I-290 (Eisenhower)】– get off at the Cicero ramp going south (towards Midway Airport) until you reach 59th Street. Make a left going eastward on 59th street. Make a right on Kildare going south, and then rely on your GPS to get to our house.

We strive to maintain the absolute highest standard of service on Airbnb. However, we are not a 5-star hotel and are therefore unable to provide everything that you would expect from a hotel. If you have specific things that you are very picky about, please discuss with us before booking.

Due to changing regulations on Airbnb in Chicago, we must ask that you maintain discretion with building staff. Please do not approach them with any requests. Definitely do not approach them to collect keys or to “check-in.”

Once you arrive, we will ask you to follow our house rules. Please read these rules carefully and take them seriously. Failure to comply can result in forfeiture of your deposit and termination of your reservation without a refund.

- This building is 100% non-smoking. No smoking or vaping of anything inside the unit or on building premises. Chicago law prohibits smoking within 15 feet of any building entrance.
- This a quiet and upscale residential building. Please observe quiet hours from 10:00 PM - 8:00 AM daily. Our neighbors are very sensitive and they will report loud noise. Any noise disturbances reported by neighbors or police will result in forfeiture of partial or full deposit.
- Absolutely no guests not in the reservation are allowed in the apartment or the building common areas.
- No pets allowed unless approved. Bringing in a pet without notice or approval will result in a forfeiture of partial or full deposit.
- Please ensure you have left the premises and returned any keys issued to you by the agreed-upon check out time. Failure to do so will result in a $250 late check out fee.
- Lockouts will result in a $150 fee per occurrence.

Everything you need is right outside your doorstep! Downtown Chicago is a city with an appetite—for food, of course, but also for design, history, and culture. Come here to marvel at the cutting-edge architecture or take in the gorgeous views of Lake Michigan; to spend a day cheering with baseball fans and a night laughing at a comedy show; to shop, to visit renowned institutions like the Field Museum, The Art Institute and the Adler Planetarium, and to experience the legendary blues scene. To do all this, you'll need nourishment: taste deep-dish pizza, piled-high hot dogs, Italian beef sandwiches, and more.

You are minutes away from bus and train stops.  

We find our guests prefer to use Uber, which is a very convenient and cheap way to get around the city. 

There is no parking available in the building, however there are several garages and lots within a block of the building.  We recommend the apps SpotHero or ParkWhiz to find and book parking.

You will be provided 1 set of keys to access the property.

Please be advised that all guests will be asked to sign a rental usage agreement that governs the terms of your stay.  For the protection of all parties, the booking party will also be required to provide a copy of a valid government issued ID and matching credit card prior to check in. This information is collected for verification purposes only and is not stored or otherwise used for any other purpose
By completing the reservation you agree to the following:
    - I agree to be bound by our rental terms and conditions.
    - I acknowledge that I will be required to provide a copy of a valid government issued ID and matching credit card prior to check in.
    - I acknowledge that I may be required to undergo a background check if mandated by the property management company or the building, as stated in accordance by my rental agreement and condition of the booking.","Before you book, please be aware of the following:

We strive to maintain the absolute highest standard of service on Airbnb. However, we are not a 5-star hotel and are therefore unable to provide everything that you would expect from a hotel. If you have specific things that you are very picky about, please discuss with us before booking.

Due to changing regulations on Airbnb in Chicago, we must ask that you maintain discretion with building staff. Please do not approach them with any requests. Definitely do not approach them to collect keys or to “check-in.”

Once you arrive, we will ask you to follow our house rules. Please read these rules carefully and take them seriously. Failure to comply can result in forfeiture of your deposit and termination of your reservation without a refund.

- This building is 100% non-smoking. No smoking or vaping of anything inside the unit or on building premises. Chicago law prohibits smoking within 15 feet of any building entrance.
- This a quiet and upscale residential building. Please observe quiet hours from 10:00 PM - 8:00 AM daily. Our neighbors are very sensitive and they will report loud noise. Any noise disturbances reported by neighbors or police will result in forfeiture of partial or full deposit.
- Absolutely no guests not in the reservation are allowed in the apartment or the building common areas.
- No pets allowed unless approved. Bringing in a pet without notice or approval will result in a forfeiture of partial or full deposit.
- Please ensure you have left the premises and returned any keys issued to you by the agreed-upon check out time. Failure to do so will result in a $250 late check out fee.
- Lockouts will result in a $150 fee per occurrence. Additionally, lost keys will incur a $250 per key fee.",,"Everything you need is right outside your doorstep!

From a gritty, partially abandoned manufacturing corridor to a burgeoning neighborhood flush with must-visit spots for foodies, eclectic art galleries and shops, and numerous acres of redeveloped park space, West Loop is now one of the hottest downtown areas in the entire country.  The famed restaurant and bar scene, close proximity to public transit and three major expressways, and downright cool, industrial atmosphere makes the West Loop a desirable location to stay, live and work. Innovative tech giants like Google, Twitter, and Uber have turned old warehouses into their new headquarters. A slew of openings centered around Randolph Street and Fulton Market make restaurant- and bar-hopping in untrodden territory a nightly possibility. You can go from taqueria to futuristic cocktail lounge, sushi bar to secret underground speakeasy, whole-animal butcher shop to wine tasting, burger bar to champagne salon—and the neighborhood’s evolution is far from finished. There’s a growing market for young families as more businesses (and young professionals) infiltrate the neighborhood. Townhomes and larger condo units can still be hard to come by as many are snapped up almost as quickly as new development blueprints can be drafted!

It's easy to get around here without a car. The Blue Line is a convenient and cost-effective way to access Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport; the Racine stop is only a five-minute walk from our building!  The 126/Jackson bus stop is right across the street and can take you straight into the loop or to the lakefront within a few minutes. Ride-sharing services (Uber, Lyft, etc.) are plentiful in our area. If you do bring a car, there's plenty of street parking in the neighborhood, and you’ll have quick access to the highway network (I-290, I-90/94 and I-55) to get you to the further parts of the Chicagoland metropolitan area.

Our past guests have enjoyed the following amenities to make their stay very comfortable and worthy of a 5-star experience: 
* Keyless entry: no need to pick up or carry around keys during your stay; just enter your host-assigned 4-digit code on the keypad
* On-site luggage storage: for day of check-in or check-out, let us know and we’ll make it happen!
* Target store: only two blocks away for all home/personal essentials, grocery, pharmacy, and even a Starbucks Coffee store
* Café L’Appetito: located right downstairs, offers fresh and authentic Italian sandwiches, coffee and gelato (opening Q4 2019!)
* Skinner Park: one block away, this beautiful park has a large children’s playground, basketball/tennis courts, a running track and open grass fields
* Chicago Police Academy: located across the street, you’ll see friendly police recruits and faculty training and teaching almost every day.","Residential building maintains quiet hours from 10pm to 8am, daily.

I am a full-time Ph.D. student and I mostly work from home. I am available to answer any questions you have about the space, the city of Chicago, and where to obtain great deep-dish pizza.

I live in South Shore. It's a diverse community with a rich history. My block is typically very quiet; most of my neighbors are elderly and have been living here a very long time. While Chicago is renowned (unfortunately) for having high crime, I have never been personally impacted. I am very cautious, I do not go for long walks late at night (regardless of the area), and I keep my doors locked. I also have a security system to keep us all safe.

Coming to a wedding? Summer internship? Attending Lolla? 
We can't wait to be part of your amazing stay. 
We  run our Victorian 4 flat like a boarding house. 
We have a huge well-lit space in a very safe neighborhood. 
Everything included: sheets, towels, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, paper towels, toilet paper, garbage bags, detergent for w/d and dishwasher, snacks, coffee/tea, cups, plates, bowls, flatware, and much much more.

This is a super upgraded century old building. It has all wood floors throughout, a brand new modern kitchen, (complete with top of the line dishwasher, washer/dryer), a tankless water heater, and a brand new furnace. It's as deluxe as you will find. And because it's old and has hardwood floors it's important to be mindful of the sound of clomping feet! It is a walkup, one flight (no elevator). There is loads of sunlight and in the spring we just leave the windows open to let in cool air and the sounds of spring. At dusk you will be introduced to a cacophony of cicadas. So prepare for that. It's amazing when they are in season.  We have cardinal and blue breast robin, that nest nearby so they will wake you up naturally if you have the windows open. It's magical! Another great feature if you dig nature. Or just close the windows and use a yucky alarm clock. We have a lovely front yard and an awesome backyard with furniture.

You can use the entire place.

You can always call or text me. I am available for anything related to the apartment or the community. Just reach out.

This is a self contained flat and you will have full access to it for your stay. I live in the building and am available if you want to chat about things to do, places to see, or how to get around.  Or you can be entirely on your own. You will find a guide to our favorite things to do and places to go inside the ""book"" box on the  coffee table and part of it is included in the neighobrhood description below.

Lovely, friendly, with kids and dogs and old people (and some new families too). It's not a trendy/hip neighborhood (just yet) so there is a lack of a huge amount of walking to restaurants and marketing shopping. However there are a few nice places that you can walk, and which I will recommend. There are loads of grocery stores about a mile away in every direction. We especially like the 24 hour hamburger stand (Suzie's) in the summer time, for shakes and grilled goodies. One ""fancy"" restaurant is located not too far away (Bread & Wine) and we send everyone there. A greasy spoon for breakfast is Golden Nugget. New to the hood is the amazing Old Irving Brewing brewpub which many guests frequent several times per week because it's so good and so close. Other stuff: I prefer Sarapino's or Lou Malnati's  for pizza, #1 Chop Suey for Chinese, and PotBelly for sandwiches. We have a couple Starbucks as well as two awesome independent coffee shops (Cafe Urbano and Coffee Roasters). All fairly close by. We go to mass at St Eds across the street. There are at least six other churches, synagogues, and mosques within walking distance.  You can't miss going to MayFair park, just a few blocks away.

Really easy actually. It's about a 10  minute walk, with luggage,  to the Blue Line which goes to the Loop in 25 min or outbound to O'Hare in about 20.  We can provide detailed instructions on how to get here from either airport using the L.
You can park on the street if you are traveling by car. If you prefer to use taxis  from the airport you can do that in their taxi line. Once you are here, taxis and  Uber cars are available to pick you up within a few minutes.

Most likely you will want to use the Blue Line to go into and out of the city,
You can stop at any of the great urban neighborhoods on the way in (Irving Park, Logan Square,  Bucktown/Wicker Park at the North & Damen stop, for example). You can take the Blue Line straight in to Clark and Lake to transfer to Orange, Brown, Purple, Pink and Greeen lines, or on to the Jackson stop and walk three blocks over to Michigan Avenue and you will be at the Chicago Architecture Foundation about a block from the Art Institute.

Buses and other options:
The Montrose bus is two blocks away and a 25 min ride to the beachfront at Lake Michigan, less than that to the Brown Line. 
The Lawrence Ave bus is a few blocks north and travels east about a mile to the Brown Line (or all the way to the lakefront, too). Brown Line goes to the Loop and stops a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue as well, with stops along the way at DePaul or Lincoln Park or Old Town.
You can transfer to the Red Line from the Brown Line at Belmont or Fullerton and go to the Apple Store Lincoln Park or keep going  and get off at Grand to walk over to North Michigan Avenue and the Magnificent Mile or on into the Loop to State Street or Michigan Avenue for the Art Institute, Millennium Park, and beyond. Lots of transportation options.

If you are traveling north (west) by car, take the Montrose exit from the Kennedy Expressway (I 90) and go east on Montrose and turn left on our street. Traveling south (east) on I94, take the Wilson Avenue exit, go east about four blocks, turn right and go to Sunnyside, turn left on Sunnyside and continue east to where it stops, then go left a couple of houses.

You will have neighbors above (me!) and below (long term regular tenants). We have never had an issue. As long as you don't have a lot of guests partying all night, we will all get along perfectly. $250 fee if you don’t return the keys.","We completely renovated the nearly 100 year old building in 2014. All new plumbing, water service, mechanicals, floors, new bath rooms with huge walk in shower and fully appointed kitchen with new appliances, Kuerig coffee maker (a wide selection of k coup coffee and tea bags), toaster (we provide the bread and muffins)  etc. So everything works.

 If you bring a pet, we require a $250 security deposit for the pet, in addition to the regular deposit.

If anything isn’t working, please contact Jeffrey immediately. Text message is probably best. Reach out if you need anything for the apartment or you just want  advice on where to go and what to do.

Checking in and out
We will provide instructions in advance of your stay. If you need to make special arrangements please contact Jeffrey.
We ask that you not use the rear access except to empty waste cans if that is necessary.

Equipment
There is a manual inside the ""book"" box on the coffee table with instructions for the printer/scanner, TV, DVD, coffee maker, dishwasher, washer and dryer and HVAC.

No candles.
Use the coasters, trivets and placemats to protect the furniture.
If you have a small child  who is still in diapers traveling with you, please take any soiled ones to the garbage cans in the backyard next to the alley ASAP (before you leave for the day). Do not leave them in the trash.

No parties. No drugs. Clean up after yourself. Basic grown up behavior.
House cleaning is every Monday at 8am. Guest must leave the premises for at least 2 hours. . 
No food of any kind is to be stored in your room. 
No guests are allowed to stay in your room over night. 
All guests must check in with the host. 

Basically, we just ask that you treat the apartment well, and have a great stay. And we hope that you will want to come back again.","You can always call or text me. I am available for anything related to the apartment or the community. Just reach out.

This is a self contained flat and you will have full access to it for your stay. I live in the building and am available if you want to chat about things to do, places to see, or how to get around.  Or you can be entirely on your own. You will find a guide to our favorite things to do and places to go inside the ""book"" box on the  coffee table and part of it is included in the neighobrhood description below.","Lovely, friendly, with kids and dogs and old people (and some new families too). It's not a trendy/hip neighborhood (just yet) so there is a lack of a huge amount of walking to restaurants and marketing shopping. However there are a few nice places that you can walk, and which I will recommend. There are loads of grocery stores about a mile away in every direction. We especially like the 24 hour hamburger stand (Suzie's) in the summer time, for shakes and grilled goodies. One ""fancy"" restaurant is located not too far away (Bread & Wine) and we send everyone there. A greasy spoon for breakfast is Golden Nugget. New to the hood is the amazing Old Irving Brewing brewpub which many guests frequent several times per week because it's so good and so close. Other stuff: I prefer Sarapino's or Lou Malnati's  for pizza, #1 Chop Suey for Chinese, and PotBelly for sandwiches. We have a couple Starbucks as well as two awesome independent coffee shops (Cafe Urbano and Coffee Roasters). All fairly close by. We go to mass at St Eds across the street. There are at least six other churches, synagogues, and mosques within walking distance.  You can't miss going to MayFair park, just a few blocks away.","You will have neighbors above (me!) and below (long term regular tenants). We have never had an issue. As long as you don't have a lot of guests partying all night, we will all get along perfectly. $250 fee if you don’t return the keys.","This is a super upgraded century old building. It has all wood floors throughout, a brand new modern kitchen, (complete with top of the line dishwasher, washer/dryer), a tankless water heater, and a brand new furnace. It's as deluxe as you will find. And because it's old and has hardwood floors it's important to be mindful of the sound of clomping feet! It is a walkup, one flight (no elevator). There is loads of sunlight and in the spring we just leave the windows open to let in cool air and the sounds of spring. At dusk you will be introduced to a cacophony of cicadas. So prepare for that. It's amazing when they are in season.  We have cardinal and blue breast robin, that nest nearby so they will wake you up naturally if you have the windows open. It's magical! Another great feature if you dig nature. Or just close the windows and use a yucky alarm clock. We have a lovely front yard and an awesome backyard with furniture.","Welcome to Chicago! Coming to a wedding? Summer internship? Attending Lolla? 
We can't wait to be part of your amazing stay. 
We  run our Victorian 4 flat like a boarding house. 
We have a huge well-lit space in a very safe neighborhood. 
Everything included: sheets, towels, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, paper towels, toilet paper, garbage bags, detergent for w/d and dishwasher, snacks, coffee/tea, cups, plates, bowls, flatware, and much much more.","Really easy actually. It's about a 10  minute walk, with luggage,  to the Blue Line which goes to the Loop in 25 min or outbound to O'Hare in about 20.  We can provide detailed instructions on how to get here from either airport using the L.
You can park on the street if you are traveling by car. If you prefer to use taxis  from the airport you can do that in their taxi line. Once you are here, taxis and  Uber cars are available to pick you up within a few minutes.

Most likely you will want to use the Blue Line to go into and out of the city,
You can stop at any of the great urban neighborhoods on the way in (Irving Park, Logan Square,  Bucktown/Wicker Park at the North & Damen stop, for example). You can take the Blue Line straight in to Clark and Lake to transfer to Orange, Brown, Purple, Pink and Greeen lines, or on to the Jackson stop and walk three blocks over to Michigan Avenue and you will be at the Chicago Architecture Foundation about a block from the Art Institute.

Buses and other options:
The Montrose bus is two blocks away and a 25 min ride to the beachfront at Lake Michigan, less than that to the Brown Line. 
The Lawrence Ave bus is a few blocks north and travels east about a mile to the Brown Line (or all the way to the lakefront, too). Brown Line goes to the Loop and stops a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue as well, with stops along the way at DePaul or Lincoln Park or Old Town.
You can transfer to the Red Line from the Brown Line at Belmont or Fullerton and go to the Apple Store Lincoln Park or keep going  and get off at Grand to walk over to North Michigan Avenue and the Magnificent Mile or on into the Loop to State Street or Michigan Avenue for the Art Institute, Millennium Park, and beyond. Lots of transportation options.

If you are traveling north (west) by car, take the Montrose exit from the Kennedy Expressway (I 90) and go east on Montrose and turn left on our street. Traveling south (east) on I94, take the Wilson Avenue exit, go east about four blocks, turn right and go to Sunnyside, turn left on Sunnyside and continue east to where it stops, then go left a couple of houses.",False,False,False,False,,True,False,100.0,"[{'milestones': {'titles': ['<b>Jan 9, 3:00PM</b>', 'Check-in'], 'subtitles': [], 'type': 'check_in'}, 'localized_cancellation_policy_name': 'Strict', 'cancellation_policy_label': 'strict_14_with_grace_period', 'cancellation_policy_price_type': None, 'cancellation_policy_price_factor': 0.0, 'cancellation_policy_id': 44, 'book_it_module_tooltip': 'Cancel before 3:00PM on Jan 2 and get a 50% refund, minus the service fee.', 'subtitle': 'Cancel before 3:00PM on Jan 2 and get a 50% refund, minus the service fee.'}]",0.0,32.0,2

With miles of jogging/biking paths, 2 historic park buildings, a small beach, and 2 large lagoons- its a must see for anyone staying on this area! Dont forget to stop at one of the many food trucks to enjoy many authentic Puerto Rican dishes!

Logan Square is so fun to explore- highly suggest walking to bars/restaurants along Armitage. Ride your Divvy bike along the 606 to explore some further neighborhoods. Armitage bus takes you right to the Blue line to downtown- you can buy hour Venture card or CTA weekend pass online. And Uber/Lyft always is a great option to get anywhere you need to go!","Upon your departure, please leave our space as you found it.

One of Chicago's creative epicenters lies just outside downtown Chicago in Wicker Park and Bucktown. These synonymous neighborhoods are famous for live music and nightlife, chef-driven restaurants and countless art galleries — many housed within the Flat Iron Arts Building. If you have an acute knowledge of craft cocktails or an affinity for coffee, plus want to sift through records or thrifted threads, there's no better area to sip and shop in the country.

The area has become a prevailing influence on Chicago's Michelin-rated, James Beard Award-winning dining scene, boasting some of the city's most sought after tables. Wicker Park and Bucktown are also known for their palate pleasing nightcaps, like renowned brewery Piece and mixology tour de force The Violet Hour.

“Experiment the adrenaline of the city from a quiet corner at one of the most representative suburbs, not too visited, vanished by a history not too often told, with locals whose daily train ride offers them someone to share their stories with. That mixture of police news at 8PM with beautiful street murals, electronic music mixed with men dancing in bus stops, mothers who bring their children to preschool mixed with gang members or basketball players, in short, the daily story of millions in the South Side, a side that left an imprint to the African-American heritage in the US, a heritage that is not too often found in books or tour guides, but that is felt and breathed in the air of the Gospel chants, the Mosque’s recites, and the streets of a city inside of a city, lost in a cloud of blurry eyes for those who have been in the ‘blocks’ for decades, with the contrast of a culture of diversity that rises from University of Chicago, the Museum of Science & Industry, the nearby bookstores, the first African American President, the birthplace of House music, the Black History Month, the teens who shoot photographs and listen to their local hip-hop artists, the speakers with basslines that deafen the small streets of this, our neighborhood. By the supermarkets you can see magazine covers announcing the return of those who once gave a name to Chicago, places, sport teams, celebrities who have walked these same sidewalks, faces full of makeup that remember a city that felt like home: the Chicago Bulls, Bears and White Sox, Michael Jordan, Oprah Winfrey, Steve Harvey, Laurence Tureaud (Mr. T), Buddy Guy, Nat King Cole, Muddy Waters, Herbie Hancock, Chaka Khan, Jennifer Hudson, Kel Mitchell, Jennifer Beals, Bernie Mac, Kanye West, Frankie Knuckles, Chance the Rapper, Common or R. Kelly come to mind. Nearby Jackson Park is Tiger Woods' projected golf conglomerate offering public basketball courts, football fields and golf courses. Historic Stony Island Avenue gave title to a 1978 movie that tells the story of the only white kid in the block that forms an R&B band. Mc Cormick Place is only minutes away; the largest convention center in North America. South Shore and the neighboring Hyde Park received national attention thanks to Barack and Michelle Obama's residence, who got married at the South Shore Cultural Center and gave lectures at the University of Chicago in Hyde Park. You can see my Airbnb Guidebook for more details about nearby transportation, groceries, restaurants, entertainment, nightlife, recreation and other points of interest in the South side: Soldier Field Stadium, Chinatown, Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Chicago State University (CSU), Adler Planetarium, Field Museum of Natural History, Wintrust Arena, Shedd Aquarium, Museum Campus, Northerly Island, Chicago Women's Park & Garden, Blues Heaven Foundation, or Buddy Guy's Legends, to name a few.”

Either the public transit, bike ride, car-share or drive to main attractions and the central business district is quite fast and convenient. 

Public Transit:
You'll find transit directions in most maps apps but here's a few of our favorite options to downtown and nearby attractions just steps away:
• Two Metra stations with two different lines; closest is Stony Island Metra Station which is just a 7-min walk from home and will have you in downtown in 23 minutes (Millennium Park), a ride that makes several stops at nearby attractions and features beautiful panoramic lake views arriving to Millennium Station.
• CTA Bus 28 (Northbound towards Hyde Park) is a 2-min walk from home and will have you at the Univ of Chicago, Hyde Park and nearby attractions on a 12-min ride; or during rush hours to downtown express in 20 to 30 minutes (Grant Park, Columbus Dr/11th, Loop). The bus also stops near the CTA “L” train at Roosevelt Station in Grant Park for the Red, Green and Orange lines.
Chicago's transit system ranks #4 of all major US cities, CTA trains/buses run every 15 minutes in average, while Metra train services run every 25 minutes during rush hours, or every hour at normal times. 

NOTE: Chicago Public Transit offers less frequencies during nighttime, weekends and holidays. There is almost NO public transit coming back home after 11PM.

Driving / Car-Share Services:
Our home is about a 15-min drive from downtown Chicago or the Midway Airport, and about a 38-min drive from O'Hare International Airport (without traffic). You can save on the O’Hare ride by taking the blue line to the city, then using an Uber, Lyft, a taxi ride or the Metra train from Millennium Station. Uber Pool and Lyft Line are widely available in Chicago; for a convenient fare you'll split with other riders you can get to/from downtown at a $12 fare approximately during normal times (not surge). Car-sharing and car rental apps like Turo, Zipcar and Getaround are easy to find and will get you a rental for the hour or the day. Enterprise Rent-A-Car is minutes from home at Stony Island Avenue.
If you prefer to use your own car, our place is conveniently located minutes away from the Chicago Skyway, the 94 and 90 Interstate Highways, and the State Route 41 (Lakeshore Drive).

Parking: 
There's usually plenty of free street parking (no permit required).

Bikes: 
Divvy Bike rentals are available only a few blocks from home and anywhere in the city, and you can pick-up and return the blue bikes anywhere there’s a Divvy station. Biking trails from here to downtown are abundant through the lakefront or the parks.

That mixture of police news at 8PM with beautiful street murals, electronic music mixed with men dancing in bus stops, mothers who bring their children to preschool mixed with gang members or basketball players, in short, the daily story of millions in the South Side, a side that left an imprint to the African-American heritage in the US, a heritage that is not too often found in books or tour guides, but that is felt and breathed in the air of the Gospel chants, the Mosque’s recites, and the streets of a city inside of a city, lost in a cloud of blurry eyes for those who have been in the ‘blocks’ for decades, with the contrast of a culture of diversity that rises from University of Chicago, the Museum of Science & Industry, the nearby bookstores, the first African American President, the birthplace of House music, the Black History Month, the teens who shoot photographs and listen to their local hip-hop artists, the speakers with basslines that deafen the small streets of this, our neighborhood. By the supermarkets you can see magazine covers announcing the return of those who once gave a name to Chicago, places, sport teams, celebrities who have walked these same sidewalks, faces full of makeup that remember a city that felt like home: the Chicago Bulls, Bears and White Sox, Michael Jordan, Oprah Winfrey, Steve Harvey, Laurence Tureaud (Mr. T), Buddy Guy, Nat King Cole, Muddy Waters, Herbie Hancock, Chaka Khan, Jennifer Hudson, Kel Mitchell, Jennifer Beals, Bernie Mac, Kanye West, Frankie Knuckles, Chance the Rapper, Common or R. Kelly come to mind. Nearby Jackson Park is Tiger Woods' projected golf conglomerate offering public basketball courts, football fields and golf courses. Historic Stony Island Avenue gave title to a 1978 movie that tells the story of the only white kid in the block that forms an R&B band. Mc Cormick Place is only minutes away; the largest convention center in North America. South Shore and the neighboring Hyde Park received national attention thanks to Barack and Michelle Obama's residence, who got married at the South Shore Cultural Center and gave lectures at the University of Chicago in Hyde Park. You can see my Airbnb Guidebook for more details about nearby transportation, groceries, restaurants, entertainment, nightlife, recreation and other points of interest in the South side: Soldier Field Stadium, Chinatown, Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Chicago State University (CSU), Adler Planetarium, Field Museum of Natural History, Wintrust Arena, Shedd Aquarium, Museum Campus, Northerly Island, Chicago Women's Park & Garden, Blues Heaven Foundation, or Buddy Guy's Legends, to name a few.”","A percentage of your payment is donated to Open Homes who help evacuees, relief workers and refugees find temporary housing, and work with some of the world’s leading nonprofits that connect people in need: International Rescue Committee, the Cancer Support Community, the All Hands and Hearts disaster relief for natural disasters, and Mercy Corps' global relief for natural disasters and crises.

Public Transit:
You'll find transit directions in most maps apps but here's a few of our favorite options to downtown and nearby attractions just steps away:
• Two Metra stations with two different lines; closest is Stony Island Metra Station which is just a 7-min walk from home and will have you in downtown in 23 minutes (Millennium Park), a ride that makes several stops at nearby attractions and features beautiful panoramic lake views arriving to Millennium Station.
• CTA Bus 28 (Northbound towards Hyde Park) is a 2-min walk from home and will have you at the Univ of Chicago, Hyde Park and nearby attractions on a 12-min ride; or during rush hours to downtown express in 20 to 30 minutes (Grant Park, Columbus Dr/11th, Loop). The bus also stops near the CTA “L” train at Roosevelt Station in Grant Park for the Red, Green and Orange lines.
Chicago's transit system ranks #4 of all major US cities, CTA trains/buses run every 15 minutes in average, while Metra train services run every 25 minutes during rush hours, or every hour at normal times.

Your choice completely! I am typically working at home doing a variety of random & artistic jobs. My roommate & I are very chill, easy going people. This is a drama free environment & it's beautiful. If you want to interact, come downstairs! Stay private... stay upstairs! Perfect!

Bucktown-WickerPark-Logan Square Neighborhood. I picked this area specifically to do AirBnB because it is safe, openminded, creative, up and coming, cool & so much more.  I have a huge backyard & there are several back decks that look over the neighborhood. You can see the Sears & Hancock from your entrance. Family oriented & steps away from city life.

One block to/from Western Blue Line (24hrs-direct to/from Ohare). One block from Armitage, Milwaukee & Western Buses (3). Street Parking Free, with exception of 1 day a month Street Cleaning (check signs). The 606 is one block away & divvy rentals are all over the place. Uber & Lyft everywhere. 

One stop North is California Blue Line. Super hipster art, bars, food & more. This area has a lot going on too, but the block from the bustle in a neighborhood setting is pretty awesome & relaxed. Wicker Park (Damen) Blue Line Stop is one stop South. Milwaukee is a very vibrant street and our location is in a perfect spot.

Boxer Boy & BlueTick Coonhound/Australian Cattle Dog Puppy live downstairs w. me. They sometimes go upstairs, but are kept out of the Air Bnb room,

We are 42o friendly. If that is an issue let me know. I want you to be comfortable! 

I talk a lot. LOL. I just do. Most people seem to enjoy it, but on my soul feel free to cut me off at anytime. I am NOT sensitive. I know a TON about the city, the cultures, the entertainment, the arts, the neighborhoods... It is the best city I know!

Living Room, 3 Bathrooms & Top Floor will always be 100% clean & open. Kitchen is accessible, but there is a possibility for mess as I cook A LOT. 

I will have cereal, yogurt, fruit & snacks and things. Help yourself. 

I have flexible check in/out. You can leave your belongings & use the shared spaces until midnight the day you check out. If I have a guest checking in that day I will need the private room available, with time for cleaning & changeover. So far this has been very easy, even with a 7am checkin and another 2pm checkout. Communication is key. 

If you need anything special let me know. Celebrating? Have a thematic purpose for your trip? I am a jack of all trades & party planning & design & hospitality are my jams. Happy to help you enhance your trip!","We are pretty relaxed. It is somewhat of a communal place. 420 friendly.

Family oriented & steps away from city life.","Boxer Boy & BlueTick Coonhound/Australian Cattle Dog Puppy live downstairs w. me. They sometimes go upstairs, but are kept out of the Air Bnb room,

We are 42o friendly. If that is an issue let me know. I want you to be comfortable! 

I talk a lot. LOL. I just do. Most people seem to enjoy it, but on my soul feel free to cut me off at anytime. I am NOT sensitive. I know a TON about the city, the cultures, the entertainment, the arts, the neighborhoods... It is the best city I know!

Living Room, 3 Bathrooms & Top Floor will always be 100% clean & open. Kitchen is accessible, but there is a possibility for mess as I cook A LOT. 

I will have cereal, yogurt, fruit & snacks and things. Help yourself. 

I have flexible check in/out. You can leave your belongings & use the shared spaces until midnight the day you check out. If I have a guest checking in that day I will need the private room available, with time for cleaning & changeover. So far this has been very easy, even with a 7am checkin and another 2pm checkout. Communication is key. 

If you need anything special let me know. Celebrating? Have a thematic purpose for your trip? I am a jack of all trades & party planning & design & hospitality are my jams. Happy to help you enhance your trip!","Spacious, sunny, art vibey, friendly & fun describe the bold characteristics, but it is completely your decision to engage with us or not! You have your own entrance & 2 adjacent restrooms on a floor shared with 1 other person.","Puppies & Privacy is exactly it!  Private Entrance/Deck/Room~just 4U. 420 friendly :-) includes snacks & goodies.

Gorgeous, sunny, comfY priVATE bdrm. 3rd flr-spectacular view! Lots of privacy w/ option to socialize. COME & GO AT ANY TIME.

This is a 30 minute drive or a 45 minute bus ride from downtown. The room is large and has a futon bunk bed, table with chairs and clothes rack. One person and several cats and dogs live in the house. The host is home at all times when guests are there, so communicating about schedules is important. The host is generally gone during the midday for work while guests are out in the city.

The guest bedroom is upstairs. There are only two rooms upstairs, the guest room and the cat room which has a couch and TV. The whole upstairs would be yours to use.

There is one bathroom for us to share. There is also a very large kitchen where you can store things in the fridge and use the microwave. There is a nice back deck and backyard that you are welcome to utilize. There is no washer and dryer for use in the building, but there is a laundromat just 2 blocks away.

Since we will be sharing space, I will be home at all times when guests are in my house. I do not give out a house key. We need to coordinate when you would expect to be at the house, so that I can make sure to be there for you. I am gone during the midday at work. Most guests are out of the house by around 10 or 11 am and return in the evening after 8pm. I am happy to hang out with you when possible to share ideas for your visit, but I'm also fine to leave you be if you prefer. Open communication about your schedule, before and during your visit, would be greatly appreciated.

The house is in the Belmont Cragin neighborhood of Chicago. It is a very residential street with lots of families and caring neighbors. I enjoy interacting with my neighbors so we can improve our community. It is a quiet street away from the hustle and bustle of the central part of the city, but close enough to get to all the fun city sites by car or public transit.

The house is two blocks away from the main bus lines of Cicero, Fullerton, Grand and Armitage. The house is a short walk from the Metra line, and one bus ride away from the blue, red or brown CTA lines. It takes about 30 minutes to get downtown by car and about 45 minutes by bus. Uber and Lyft are very popular and easy to utilize in Chicago.","I get up each day around 7 and work from home in the mornings. I get home from work on most nights around 7pm and go to bed around 11.  I would appreciate it if guests were in and quiet by midnight. There is no smoking in the house, but you are welcome to smoke on the back deck as long as you use an ashtray. You are free to store food in the fridge and warm things up in the microwave. There are disposable plates, cups, napkins and silverware in your room for your use. Please dispose of all food related trash in the trashcan by the kitchen to keep bugs out of your room. I would appreciate open communication about your schedule during your stay so I know when to expect you.","Since we will be sharing space, I will be home at all times when guests are in my house.

Many of the city’s top attractions are a short walk or ride away from each other. Weather-permitting, walking is the best way to see the city and the hidden treasures of architecture and public art in the downtown area.
When planning your route, keep in mind that every 8 blocks equals 1 mile.

Chicago Public Transportation (CTA)
The buses and trains of the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) are a fast and cost-effective way to get into and around the city. Known as the “L” (though they may be elevated or underground) the trains are a fun way to see The Loop from a new vantage point.
CTA visitor passes offer the best value, with unlimited rides on all CTA trains and buses. A 1-day pass is $10, a 3-day pass is $20, and a 7-day pass is $28.
Passes are easy to use. They activate the first time you use them and are valid for the number of consecutive days purchased. Just dip your pass into the bus fare machine or the train station turnstile.
Check the CTA website for the latest fares, travel alerts, and trip planners.

Taxis
Taxis are abundant throughout most of Chicago so finding a cab is typically easy. Taxi rates depend on gas prices and number of passengers and can get a bit pricey but provide a fast and convenient way to get around the city, particularly beyond downtown.

Biking
If time and weather permit, consider renting a bike. Chicago’s lakefront boasts 26 uninterrupted miles of easy bike and walking trails.
Half-day rentals are available from Bike and Roll at Navy Pier and Millennium Park.


From the Airports

O’Hare International Airport: 
Chicago’s O’Hare is one of the world’s busiest airports. It’s about 15 miles northwest of the Loop in downtown Chicago. O’Hare has 5 terminals, all of which have information booths and multilingual employees to assist you.

Midway International Airport:
Although it’s smaller than O’Hare, Midway is closer to the Loop and services more discount airlines (but fewer airlines overall). If you’re looking for a good deal on plane tickets, check out flights to Midway.

Living Room – Guests are more than welcomed to lounge and chill in the living room. The living room is highly equipped for the perfect media experience. 

Cloud Server – Throughout the entire house, I've setup a NAS (Network-attached storage). In my massive collection, I've about 12 TB's of movies, TV shows, cartoons, anime, documentaries, music, and such. You'll have access to all of this media upon connecting to my wi-fi.

Downtown isn't far either!

The entire room is yours to use! Just be respectful and sanitary of the room -- common sense! As you can see, the room is highly decorated with an assorted and variety of posters. You'll have access to a small library of books; ranging from languages to college textbooks that'll fiddle your interest should you feel like staying indoors. The mattress is a loft-style full-size bed, accompanied with a mini-office beneath it.

I've also a Roku 3 attached to the TV; so you can stream content from your device onto the TV, stream media from massive cloud server (12 TB's), or watch videos on native apps like Netflix or Hulu via the Roku 3. It's also got an auxiliary (earphones or headphones plug) connection, so that you can binge watch your favorite show without disturbing others at night. Or if you're too ashamed to openly watch My Little Pony, then you can watch it at your discretion.

【IMPORTANT】
For families or groups of three, PLEASE INQUIRE ABOUT PRICING. I am more than happy to accommodate 3 people into the room should you be staying with us. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU ASK ABOUT THIS SHOULD YOU WANT THE THIRD PERSON TO STAY WITH US, as we need to see how we can accommodate your +3.

Please note that for safety and security reasons there is a NEST indoor camera planted at the MAIN ENTRANCE of the house, right by the top window. As soon as you enter the house you will see it with a glowing green dot. This is to ensure people arrive on time, properly, and safe & sound.

The room is yours for the duration of the stay. Make yourselves at home; you're no stranger in this household. So asides from the room, you'll have access to things like... :

Washroom – The washroom is fully stocked with plentiful of towels, soap, first-aid kit, shampoos, lotions, perfumes, colognes, etc etc. If you need something specific there's a Walgreens within walking distance (5 minutes). There's also a Target and Wal-Mart within driving distance too.

Kitchen – Hungry? Thirsty? Aching to cook? Go for it! Our kitchen is fully stocked. You're more than welcome to store your food or edibles in the refrigerator. All we ask is that you clean up after you finish using whatever it is that you cooked or drank with. There's a dozen or so grocers nearby, so ask about them should you want to cook or fatten up., or want to some late-night snacks. 

Living Room – Guests are more than welcomed to lounge and chill in the living room. The living room is highly equipped for the perfect media experience. 

Cloud Server – Throughout the entire house, I've setup a NAS (Network-attached storage). In my massive collection, I've about 12 TB's of movies, TV shows, cartoons, anime, documentaries, music, and such. You'll have access to all of this media upon connecting to my wi-fi. Help yourself to anything you see should you decide to stay indoors or be a long-term guest. Or, if you're cooking or before you go to sleep!

IMPORTANT: I am abroad for work, so my folks will be taking care of your needs. We are very FLEXIBLE with check-in and check-out times. Depending on the schedule for our rooms, you can check-in/check-out earlier/later.  It is IMPORTANT that you communicate with us your arrival times so that we can make your experience/stay absolutely amazing. Please text my mom and myself or either of us, preferably both so that we're on top of our game to best make you feel at home.


IF YOU HAVE A PET, PLEASE LET ME KNOW BEFORE YOU BOOK WITH US. WE HAVE TO SEE IF ITS OKAY. OTHERWISE WE WILL DENY YOU ENTRY.


ALSO IMPORTANT:  We have three dogs on the floor you'll be staying. Sometimes they bark and sometimes they're loud, but it's nothing beyond our control. They easily get along with everyone. So if dogs are a bit of a problem, we will try out best to keep them at a distance. If you're allergic to dogs, then this our home might be a bit difficult for you. Please take that into consideration prior to booking with us. If you love dogs? Perfect! My dogs will absolutely love you!

Worried about safety? Not an issue! The neighborhood is relatively safe, so you don't have to worry about that gun violence/murders you hear media grossly exaggerated on the news. There are plentiful of grocers and supermarkets in case you feel like cooking -- cheaper and as good as a Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. Are you also worried about parking your car? Don't sweat it! This is an entirely blue-collar family neighborhood, so you'll see neighbors and folks out and about on the streets attending to their houses or chatting. Since most homes are family owned, you'll mostly see people outdoors chit-chatting away. There's also 2 parks nearby in case you feel like relaxing and enjoying some green; by green I mean nature-like feel... You can also go out for a job; some guests often jog around Midway Airport for some exercise. There's ton of Mexican food should you get hungry, and when I mean Mexican food, I'm talking about authentic real experience Mexican food just the way mama use to make it!

Midway Airport is literally within walking distance to our house. You can either walk it (15 minutes or less) or bus it ( 10 minutes #59 going west) or taxi/Uber it (3 minutes). The nearest CTA (public transportation) station, Midway Orange Line Station, is literally next door to the airport. The nearest bus stops are the:

* #59 - runs east and west of 59th Street (this bus can take you to the University of Chicago and is about a 30-minute commute). 
* #53A - runs north and south of Pulaski. 
* #63 - runs east and west of 63rd Street.

The Midway Orange Line Station is also a bus terminal and you'll have access to a variety of other bus routes that go everywhere. It is generally a 35-40 minute commute to downtown Chicago from the station. During rush hours, it is a 25-minute trip.

If your flight is arriving at Midway Airport, then this is by far the easiest and most convenient walk you'll have to take; odds are, you booked with us because it's so darn close to Midway, haha. Once you've landed and have picked up your luggage, head towards the train station exit that leads into the city. From there, you can walk east (away from the airport, towards the lake) on 59th Street until you reach South Tripp Avenue and walk until you reach our house. Or you can take the #59 CTA bus all the way to South Keeler Avenue (one block east of South Tripp) and then proceed to walk to our house. You can also taxi it as well if you’re feel lucky, but you’ll be charged about $20 and up for the convenience of arriving within 5 minutes. The taxi’s are located on the ground floor by the arrival area, just outside to where you pick up your luggage. UberX can't pick you up directly at the airport, but there is a loophole. Please inquire about should you decide you'd want to Uber it.

If you're arriving at O’Hare Airport, then you're in for a treat. Once you landed, picked up your luggage, follow the signs that lead into the city (via an underground passageway). You can purchase one of those Ventra cards from those Ventra kiosks’. Chicago has a warm way of welcoming tourists and visitors in the city by charging them $5.00 to board the CTA Blue Line into the city. You might as well purchase a 1‐day pass (3-day or 7-day depending on the length of your stay) for the convenience. Board the Blue Line towards the city and transfer trains at Clark/Lake stop. Make your way towards the elevated tracks and board the Orange Line going towards Midway. You will be getting off at the very last stop, which is Midway. The total time from O’Hare Airport to Midway Orange Line Station is roughly about an hour‐and‐a‐half. At the Orange Line Midway Airport stop, you can walk east (away from the airport, towards the lake) on 59th Street until you reach South Tripp Avenue and walk until you reach our house. Or you can take the #59 CTA bus all the way to South Keeler Avenue (one block east of South Tripp) and then proceed to walk to our house. Alternatively, you can also taxi if you just want to arrive quickly, but you’ll be charged about $40‐45. I highly advise against it too unless time is more important to you; keep in mind traffic is horrendous between 7‐9 a.m and 3‐6 p.m. An Uber will run you around the same price as well.

From Union Station, you walk east (towards the lake and crossing the river) of either Jackson or Adams, and walk until you reach Wells (a north/south street). You'll see sign for the Quincy/Wells CTA station. You’ll want to take the Orange Line going towards Midway Airport. This will be the platform that is on the east side of Wells. Take the Orange Line all the way to Midway Airport. Once you're at the Midway Airport station, you can walk east (away from the airport, towards the lake) on 59th Street until you reach South Tripp Avenue and walk until you reach our house. Or you can take the #59 CTA bus all the way to South Keeler Avenue (one block east of South Tripp) and then proceed to walk to our house. You can take a taxi, and that'll run you around $25. An UberX will run you around $20.

If you've arrived at the Greyhound Station on Harrison Street, walk to the Clinton Blue Line stop, and take the train going in the direction of Forest Park. Get off at the Clark/Lake stop and transfer to the Orange Line going to Midway Airport. Take the Orange Line all the way to Midway Airport. Once you're at the Midway Airport station, you can walk east (away from the airport, towards the lake) on 59th Street until you reach South Tripp Avenue and walk until you reach our house. Or you can take the #59 CTA bus all the way to South Keeler Avenue (one block east of South Tripp) and then proceed to walk to our house. You can take a taxi, and that'll run you around $25. An UberX will run you around $20.

If you're driving, then there's several routes:

【 I-55 (Steveson)】– get off at the Cicero ramp going south (towards Midway Airport) until you reach 59th Street. Make a left going eastward on 59th street. Make a right on Kildare going south, and then rely on your GPS to get to our house. 

【 I-90-94 (Dan Ryan - northbound)】– get off at the 59th Street ramp going westward (away from the lake). Go west on 59th until you reach (you'll get closer once you've passed Pulaski) Keeler. Make a left on Keeler and then rely on your GPS to find our home. 

【I-90/94 (Edens/Kennedy - southbound)】–drive south into the city and merge onto the I-55 (Steveson) expressway. Get off at the Pulaski ramp going southbound of Pulaski (on your left). Continue until you reach 61st Street and make a right, and use your GPS from here on. 

 【I-290 (Eisenhower)】– get off at the Cicero ramp going south (towards Midway Airport) until you reach 59th Street. Make a left going eastward on 59th street. Make a right on Kildare going south, and then rely on your GPS to get to our house.

NOTES: 
(1) REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY (see below)
(2) The host typically would like to greet the guests in person, occasionally this may not be possible.  In the latter case, please contact the host for the procedure of ""Self Check-in"". 
(3) Typically we can arrange 24-hour FREE street parking (just in the front or near the front of the house) for up to 30 days of stays.  It is the Guests' responsibility to do a simple registration with the village for street parking (Please ask the host for details). Street parking is pretty safe in this area as it is safe to begin with and the village polices are very  diligent in patrolling.  However if you still want a garage parking for some reasons, the cost is $6 per day and its availability is on the first come first serve basis.  The payment for Garage Parking needs to be made right after your booking for securing the garage space. If you stay in the house for more than one month, please discuss the parking matter with the host as part of your booking process.

REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY
Guests choose a place to stay based what it serves them the best.  We would like to highlight a few items worth considering and invite you to book this place.
(a) We run a very efficient operation and have a very competitive room rate with high quality rooms and services;
(b) This house has an exceptional great location.  It is about 7 minutes to Blue Line Austin Station by walking (hence very close to downtown Chicago) and has convenient access to west, north west, and south west of greater Chicagoland by car.
(c) Free parking up to a month can be easily arranged.  Parking can be very very expensive in any larger metropolitan, including downtown Chicago.  Therefore it is much more economical to park here and take the train to downtown Chicago. If you rent a room in or near downtown Chicago, you implicitly or explicitly spend a lot of money just on parking.
(d) The ""Occupancy Tax"" is about 11% here which is much less than 23% or higher (doubled) in Chicago. The occupancy tax is paid by the guests based on the sum of room rate and cleaning fee.  With this tax and parking cost in mind, it is much more economical (and without losing convenient access to downtown Chicago) to stay in a convenient suburbs rather than in Chicago or downtown Chicago. Since the ""Occupancy Tax"" is waived if you stay 31 days or longer, you can avoid this tax and save quite a bit of money if you plan your trip ahead and check with the host for room availability.

0,"1. You’re living like a local, be respectful of the other locals. We mean, c’mon, how would you feel if your neighbor wasn’t super awesome? 

2. All of our Rental Units are smoke-free environments. Even on the balcony, if you have one. We’re super sorry if this is a bummer, but it’s our policy. Hopefully we told you about it ahead of time and you aren’t super surprised that we still mean it. 

3. Pets are super awesome, but they aren’t allowed in our Rental Units. However, if your fur kiddo is a service animal then give us a call and we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your needs, as required by law.  

4. Your trip details should already be complete. If they aren’t, give us a call ASAP so we can rectify that! What’s a little information between friends?  

5. Your friend, your responsibility. Pretty simple, if you invite them to your Rental Unit, you’re responsible for their actions.  

6. While watching a million people get out of a clown car is hilarious, there are occupancy rules Stay Alfred must follow for each of our buildings. Help us follow the rules and check your rental contract for occupancy requirements. If you exceed it, don’t worry! Give us a call and we’ll get you one of our bigger travel apartments. (It’s like needing an Uber XL when you have a ton of people with you!) 

7. We’re here to help! The onsite building staff doesn’t work for Stay Alfred…strange, right? So, if you need something, send us a chat, or just give us a call. Our awesome Guest Services department will assist you 24/7.

heart of Chicago’s South Loop

These stylish South Loop travel apartments are the perfect home base for any trip to Chicago, whether you’re coming to town on business or for a vacation with the fam. Nestled between Chi-Town highlights like the Field Museum and sprawling Grant Park, every apartment features a spacious floor plan, a full kitchen with modern appliances, and essentials like cable TV and free, fast WiFi. The building certainly doesn’t skimp on the amenities either, with a resident lounge, business center, and a sunny rooftop deck with barbecue stations.

We believe in personal space. Prior to your arrival, your unit will be professionally cleaned and your self guided check in process ensures easy arrival with no long lines. Should you need us, we’re here 24/7 with our guest services team and local folks on the ground. And if you don’t need us, we’ll stay out of your way. After all, this is your place in the city.

Chicago’s South Loop neighborhood is home to some of the city’s top things to do and places to eat - with a more laid-back atmosphere than the hustling, bustling Magnificent Mile. In this hip district, you’ll find enormous, green parks like the Museum Campus and Northerly Island (not to mention Grant Park!) and streets that are a pedestrian’s dream with nice wide sidewalks. Cultural attractions abound, from the Field Museum to the Adler Planetarium to arts venues like the intimate M Lounge and storied Arie Crown Theater.

We furnish all of our properties to a uniform standard, but individual units may differ slightly from the pictures shown.","1. You’re living like a local, be respectful of the other locals. We mean, c’mon, how would you feel if your neighbor wasn’t super awesome? 

2. All of our Rental Units are smoke-free environments. Even on the balcony, if you have one. We’re super sorry if this is a bummer, but it’s our policy. Hopefully we told you about it ahead of time and you aren’t super surprised that we still mean it. 

3. Pets are super awesome, but they aren’t allowed in our Rental Units. However, if your fur kiddo is a service animal then give us a call and we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your needs, as required by law.  

4. Your trip details should already be complete. If they aren’t, give us a call ASAP so we can rectify that! What’s a little information between friends?  

5. Your friend, your responsibility. Pretty simple, if you invite them to your Rental Unit, you’re responsible for their actions.  

6. While watching a million people get out of a clown car is hilarious, there are occupancy rules Stay Alfred must follow for each of our buildings. Help us follow the rules and check your rental contract for occupancy requirements. If you exceed it, don’t worry! Give us a call and we’ll get you one of our bigger travel apartments. (It’s like needing an Uber XL when you have a ton of people with you!) 

7. We’re here to help! The onsite building staff doesn’t work for Stay Alfred…strange, right? So, if you need something, send us a chat, or just give us a call. Our awesome Guest Services department will assist you 24/7.

8. Take only memories, leave only the keys, fobs, parking passes, etc. behind. They won’t help you out when you get home and it’s a total pain to have to replace them. 

9. We love gifts, but the greatest gift is making sure you don’t leave anything behind. We suggest taking one last look around before you head home as fees are associated with sending you your belongings. Trust us, the extra five minutes is worth it! 

10. Ugh, here’s the hard one. Should you break anything, really mess something up, or decide to stay longer than your agreed upon length of stay, we have the right to charge you additional fees, but we’d really rather not (and, we’re sure you’d rather not too!)

Other guests have described Northcenter as delightful, close to everything, convenient to public transportation and highways, safe, comfortable, and not congested.

Kitschy and cool, cozy and comfortable - a second floor private suite in a classic Chicago Victorian frame house on a quiet neighborhood street. A small apartment that's all yours. Dog friendly and no cleaning fee!

Located in the vibrant Logan Square/Bucktown/Wicker Park neighborhood, a hot spot of great dining, shopping and entertainment, I am renting the back half of the second floor of my Chicago Victorian frame house - a totally private small apartment suite! Built in 1889, renovated over the years with vintage and antique appeal, it has charm and style. You can also enjoy my lovely backyard - the perfect place to have morning coffee in summertime.

Accommodation includes a queen size bed, private bathroom with shower, a living space including wi-fi, Keurig coffee maker, microwave, and small fridge. Always outfit with fresh linens and towels, and roku. I will give you keys, and you can come and go as you wish, with access though the back yard and back door.

The suite includes a small, enclosed back porch area, perfect for morning coffee.
I have a small recording studio on the third floor, primarily used for mixing and mastering, with sporadic rehearsal/recording sessions. So you may hear some sweet tunes wafting down. 

Comfortable and stylish, walking distance from the Chicago Blue line (direct to O'Hare International Airport and downtown), and right off the Kennedy expressway (Fullerton exit, US 90/94) usually with ample free street parking. 

The suite has central heat and central air, which I happy to adjust for your comfort, as I control it from the front part of the apartment.
The suite has snacks and beverages, at no extra charge. The house doggie mascots, Stranger & Schnitzel, love company!

* I can accommodate a third person, but only on an air mattress set up in the living area of the suite. Additional charge would apply.

I am friendly and helpful, but I enjoy my privacy. I am available to help most of the time and I tend to respond quickly if I am not in a mid flight.

I love my neighborhood! I feel safe living here. I do advice to exercise some caution everywhere though Chicago, and this neighborhood is no exception. The Near West Side , one of the 77 community areas of Chicago, is on the West Side, west of the Chicago River and adjacent to the Loop and West Loop. The history of the Near West Side of Chicago includes the founding of Hull House, a prominent settlement house. The Great Chicago Fire started in the Near West Side. The area is home to the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), the United Center and the Illinois Medical District. It's not a very walkable neighborhood, but bigger streets such as Madison and Western are more interesting and safer to walk through.

My listings are very close to public transportation. The bus stop is right on the intersection and my house is 5th from a major intersection with 2 buses.  The way chicago works is that each bus goes in a straight line. Madison bus goes to downtown, loop, Sears (Willis) tower and Millennium Park, and Western bus goes to different neighborhoods such as Bucktown and Wicker Park and Medical District.  Blue line is about 8 minute walk, and Green Line is about a 10 minute walk. Both lines go to downtown, loop and blue line goes to the airport.  Also if you get Uber and use UberPool, it's only about $2.50-3$ to get around which is not that much different from public transportation prices ($2-$2.25), however Uber now changes their prices constantly so I find that sometimes its low prices, and sometimes its triple.

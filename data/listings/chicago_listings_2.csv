It’s the ideal retreat for a comfortable & cozy stay, located to the south of Chicago. We believe it’s the ultimate location to find some seclusion while needing to be close to downtown Chicago. Get ready to get inspired! Very close to a pristine stretch of lakefront. All in all, guaranteed enjoyment and relaxation. All day long.

This simply styled room makes for a perfectly convenient getaway. Ideal for couples who need to be in the area. But an especially great space for solo and business travelers. Great for people looking for a laid back place to stay. Perfect if you want to be close to the hustle and bustle of Chicago but not right in the middle of it. If you need it, it’s a 20minute drive to downtown. Comfortable, calm and convenient. We love to go that extra mile, so you feel like you are at home.

Without a doubt, this place makes for a true “revival” for those in need of one. We are sure you will enjoy this room as much as we do.

We’ll supply you with:
- Ultra comfortable bed Linen
- Towels
- Bathrobes
- Toiletries
- Fast & Free Wi-Fi
- Fully stocked fridge

We guarantee a private stay. The bathroom is shared with three other rooms. Upon your arrival, we will stock up the fridge with fresh milk, yogurts, cereals, drinks and some other healthy and extremely tasteful essentials. To make sure you have the basics without having to leave home to get them.

We have provided teas, coffee, and snacks, so all that’s left for you to do is relax and settle in after your journey. Or if you prefer, you can enjoy a refreshing shower; we have stocked the bathroom with gentle toiletries.

The home is located on a very quiet block less than nine miles from downtown Chicago and two to three miles from the University of Chicago campus and the Museum of Science and Industry. It is also located within blocks of the future site for the Obama Presidential Library.
Hyde park, many biking trails, lakefront, restaurants, supermarkets, Starbucks, Jackson Park Hospital and much more are just a stone throw away.

It's cozy and affordable and only available if my daughter is not using it. 
A single bed (best mattress in the building!) is all yours in this spacious 3rd floor walk up (no elevator) in a huge, sunny 4 bedroom apartment with 1.5 bath. Totally gut-rehabbed in 2014.  You will have the middle  bedroom. You are welcome to use the fully equipped kitchen; just clean up after yourself. You will enjoy super fast Wi-Fi internet, premium cable TV/Netflix/Amazon and a 50 inch smart TV. Please check the map before you book. This is great access to freeway and close to O'Hare and short drive to hot spots downtown, even closer to Bucktown, Wicker Park, really close to Logan Square but NOT walking distance to much.

I am totally available via text any time day or night. 312-961-4742
Do not hesitate to contact me any time for any reason of you need anything or have a concern of any kind.

Really easy actually. It's about a 10  minute walk, with luggage,  to the Blue Line which goes to the Loop in 25 min or outbound to O'Hare in about 20.  We can provide detailed instructions on how to get here from either airport using the L.
You can park on the street if you are traveling by car. If you prefer to use taxis  from the airport you can do that in their taxi line. Once you are here, taxis and  Uber cars are available to pick you up within a few minutes.

Most likely you will want to use the Blue Line to go into and out of the city,
You can stop at any of the great urban neighborhoods on the way in (Irving Park, Logan Square,  Bucktown/Wicker Park at the North & Damen stop, for example). You can take the Blue Line straight in to Clark and Lake to transfer to Orange, Brown, Purple, Pink and Greeen lines, or on to the Jackson stop and walk three blocks over to Michigan Avenue and you will be at the Chicago Architecture Foundation about a block from the Art Institute.

Buses and other options:
The Montrose bus is two blocks away and a 25 min ride to the beachfront at Lake Michigan, less than that to the Brown Line. 
The Lawrence Ave bus is a few blocks north and travels east about a mile to the Brown Line (or all the way to the lakefront, too). Brown Line goes to the Loop and stops a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue as well, with stops along the way at DePaul or Lincoln Park or Old Town.
You can transfer to the Red Line from the Brown Line at Belmont or Fullerton and go to the Apple Store Lincoln Park or keep going  and get off at Grand to walk over to North Michigan Avenue and the Magnificent Mile or on into the Loop to State Street or Michigan Avenue for the Art Institute, Millennium Park, and beyond. Lots of transportation options.

If you are traveling north (west) by car, take the Montrose exit from the Kennedy Expressway (I 90) and go east on Montrose and turn left on our street. Traveling south (east) on I94, take the Wilson Avenue exit, go east about four blocks, turn right and go to Sunnyside, turn left on Sunnyside and continue east to where it stops, then go left a couple of houses.

We got a Labrador puppy last year. Cassius. He’s 1 year now in 2019. Super friendly. Horrible guard dog. Loves all people. Sleeps in the way back porch. Never in anyone’s room, unless you invite him.

Halfway between O'Hare and the Loop, private bedroom/bathroom in a sunny third floor walkup apartment, with HUGE walk-in shower, access to fully appointed kitchen, day bed, Washer/dryer, Wi-Fi internet, premier cable TV/Netflix, all amenities. Blue Line or street parking. Please check map before booking.","Really easy actually. It's about a 10  minute walk, with luggage,  to the Blue Line which goes to the Loop in 25 min or outbound to O'Hare in about 20.  We can provide detailed instructions on how to get here from either airport using the L.
You can park on the street if you are traveling by car. If you prefer to use taxis  from the airport you can do that in their taxi line. Once you are here, taxis and  Uber cars are available to pick you up within a few minutes.

Most likely you will want to use the Blue Line to go into and out of the city,
You can stop at any of the great urban neighborhoods on the way in (Irving Park, Logan Square,  Bucktown/Wicker Park at the North & Damen stop, for example). You can take the Blue Line straight in to Clark and Lake to transfer to Orange, Brown, Purple, Pink and Greeen lines, or on to the Jackson stop and walk three blocks over to Michigan Avenue and you will be at the Chicago Architecture Foundation about a block from the Art Institute.

Buses and other options:
The Montrose bus is two blocks away and a 25 min ride to the beachfront at Lake Michigan, less than that to the Brown Line. 
The Lawrence Ave bus is a few blocks north and travels east about a mile to the Brown Line (or all the way to the lakefront, too). Brown Line goes to the Loop and stops a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue as well, with stops along the way at DePaul or Lincoln Park or Old Town.
You can transfer to the Red Line from the Brown Line at Belmont or Fullerton and go to the Apple Store Lincoln Park or keep going  and get off at Grand to walk over to North Michigan Avenue and the Magnificent Mile or on into the Loop to State Street or Michigan Avenue for the Art Institute, Millennium Park, and beyond. Lots of transportation options.

If you are traveling north (west) by car, take the Montrose exit from the Kennedy Expressway (I 90) and go east on Montrose and turn left on our street. Traveling south (east) on I94, take the Wilson Avenue exit, go east about four blocks, turn right and go to Sunnyside, turn left on Sunnyside and continue east to where it stops, then go left a couple of houses.",False,False,False,False,,True,False,100.0,"[{'milestones': {'titles': ['<b>Jan 11, 3:00PM</b>', 'Check-in'], 'subtitles': [], 'type': 'check_in'}, 'localized_cancellation_policy_name': 'Strict', 'cancellation_policy_label': 'strict_14_with_grace_period', 'cancellation_policy_price_type': None, 'cancellation_policy_price_factor': 0.0, 'cancellation_policy_id': 44, 'book_it_module_tooltip': 'After that, cancel before 3:00PM on Jan 4 and get a 50% refund, minus the service fee.', 'subtitle': 'After that, cancel before 3:00PM on Jan 4 and get a 50% refund, minus the service fee.'}]",0.0,0.0,0,2020-01-11,2020-01-13,2019-12-28,2019-10-14 21:05:20+00:00,2017-05-31 18:36:21+00:00

The guest bedroom is at the end of the hallway away from the living room and the master bedroom so there is plenty of privacy for guests.

Buena Park is a neighborhood within Chicago's Uptown community bordered by one of the most historical sites in Chicago, the Graceland Cemetery and Arboretum, founded in 1860 and on the National Register of Historic Places. Lake Michigan is on the eastern border with bike and running/walking paths. You can be on Montrose beach in minutes. The popular Lakeview and Wrigleyville neighborhoods are a short walk south and Uptown/Andersonville are just to the north.

My condo is literally steps away from several public transportation options.  The Sheridan red line stop is two blocks away, the #36 Broadway bus is at the end of the street and the #151 bus is at the other end. Express buses to Michigan Avenue and the Loop are also a short walk away. There are two Divvy bike stations within 2 blocks.

The Near West Side , one of the 77 community areas of Chicago, is on the West Side, west of the Chicago River and adjacent to the Loop and West Loop. The history of the Near West Side of Chicago includes the founding of Hull House, a prominent settlement house. The Great Chicago Fire started in the Near West Side. The area is home to the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), the United Center and the Illinois Medical (URL HIDDEN) not a very walkable neighborhood, but bigger streets such as Madison and Western are more interesting to walk through.

My listings are very close to public transportation. The bus stop is right on the intersection and my house is 5th from a major intersection with 2 buses.  The way chicago works is that each bus goes in a straight line. Madison bus goes to downtown, loop, Sears (Willis) tower and Millennium Park, and Western bus goes to different neighborhoods such as Bucktown and Wicker Park.  Blue line is about 8 minute walk, and also goes to downtown, loop and the airport.  Also if you get Uber and use UberPool, its only about $2.50-3$ to get around which is not that much different from public transportation prices ($2-$2.25).

A few short steps from the popular 606 park as well as Palmer Square park. Super close access to Divvy bikes for a ride on the 606 too.

Guests will have the entire main floor apartment to themselves, this apartment is solely used for vacation rentals and is not a lived in residence unlike other local listings.

We will be more than happy to help you find your way around the neighborhood and offer suggestions of our favorite places and activities, just ask! If not, we will leave you to enjoy and explore on your own.

Cheap eats and bike-friendly streets. Gourmet coffee, scruffy dive bars and artisanal cocktail lounges. Some may say it's a recipe for a hipster haven but there's a proud, working-class sensibility that keeps this Northwest Side neighborhood grounded. In Logan Square, the strong neighborly connection is evident all around, from active preservation groups to community gardens and a locally-run farmers market. ""Local"" being the key word when describing many aspects of the scene: ingredients are sourced locally at their buzz-worthy restaurants; corner taps tout local, craft brews; galleries showcase local artists; and concerts and street fests promote local, upstart bands.
At the heart of this community is the actual ""square"" in Logan Square. It comes together at the intersection of Kedzie and Logan Boulevard, where a circle interchange meets with Milwaukee Avenue. The boulevards themselves are widened thoroughfares that are set apart by grassy, landscaped medians and tall, stately trees that border both its sides. The neighborhood boasts four of them in total and these link together to form Chicago's ""Emerald Necklace,"" an expansive system of interconnected parks and streetscapes dotted with beautifully-restored mansions, handsome greystone homes and majestic churches.

There are several CTA bus lines close by, as well a few blue line train stops within a 15 minute walk. I would also suggest Divvy bikes (especially a ride on the 606), and for longer trips, Uber is the fastest in the area.","As to not disturb the neighbors and other tenants we request quiet time between 10pm and 8am.

No additional guests allowed on property unless cleared in advance with owner.

Pulitzer Prize recipient Gwendolyn Brooks, civil rights activist Ida B. Wells, and legendary musician Louis Armstrong were profoundly responsible for the area's development and subsequent cultural crusade, which included advances in civil rights, jazz, blues and gospel music as well.

As Chicago's official downtown area, the Loop is one of the most important central business districts on the globe. In addition to its dynamic architecture and buzzing atmosphere, the area has an incredible concentration of cultural institutions, urban park spaces, award-winning restaurants and a shopper's paradise on State Street.
Famous for its striking architecture, the Loop vaunts signature buildings by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Louis Henri Sullivan, as well as Aqua by modern day prodigy Jeanne Gang. The area hangout, Millennium Park, complements its surrounding with stunning architectural marvels of its own. The park's crown jewels include a Frank Gehry-designed amphitheater and Cloud Gate, the landmark ""Bean"" that's become an iconic symbol of Chicago. Nearby Maggie Daley Park and the Chicago Riverwalk are two new engaging outdoor spaces that embrace design — and fun!
In addition to architectural marvels, Chicago's cultural attractions also have a prevailing presence in the downtown Loop. The celebrated Theater District buzzes with Tony Award-winning shows and glittering marquees. The Chicago Cultural Center provides an incredible range of performance and visual arts, while the Art Institute of Chicago is widely considered to be one of the finest institutions of its kind in the world.

"House Rules

1.  Please be respectful of our neighbors.  No excessive noises and no parties.  

1-a.  If you are going to park in the reserved spot please let me know your make/model and license plate.

2.  Please take off your shoes.  I'm asian and that's what we do in the house =)  High heels make divots on the wood floors, so please do not wear them in the condo.

3.  No smoking in the condo or on the patio.

4.  Please do not overload the washer or dryer.  

5.  If you use the washer please keep the door open so that the inside of the machine dries properly.

6.  If the garbage is full there are extra bags under the sink.  The community garbage bins are around the back of the apartment, near the parking lot.

7.  Please turn off lights and make sure the patio door is locked when leaving the condo.

8.  Sheets are cleaned after each guest.  If you have time please take off the sheets and put them in the bedroom hamper.

9.  Turning on the bathroom vent prevents excess moisture from building up, please use it when taking a shower

10.  Please rinse the dishes & cups prior to placing them in the dishwasher.  Dishwasher detergent is located under the sink.

11.  Please do not overload the garbage disposal in the sink (small amounts of left over food are ok; eggshells and chunks of meat and veggies are not)

12.  Please turn off A/C or heat when leaving the apartment.

13.  As a reminder, we don't allow pets in the condo.

1.  Please be respectful of our neighbors.  No excessive noises and no parties.  

1-a.  If you are going to park in the reserved spot please let me know your make/model and license plate.

2.  Please take off your shoes.  I'm asian and that's what we do in the house =)  High heels make divots on the wood floors, so please do not wear them in the condo.

3.  No smoking in the condo or on the patio.

4.  Please do not overload the washer or dryer.  

5.  If you use the washer please keep the door open so that the inside of the machine dries properly.

6.  If the garbage is full there are extra bags under the sink.  The community garbage bins are around the back of the apartment, near the parking lot.

7.  Please turn off lights and make sure the patio door is locked when leaving the condo.

8.  Sheets are cleaned after each guest.  If you have time please take off the sheets and put them in the bedroom hamper.

9.  Turning on the bathroom vent prevents excess moisture from building up, please use it when taking a shower

10.  Please rinse the dishes & cups prior to placing them in the dishwasher.  Dishwasher detergent is located under the sink.

11.  Please do not overload the garbage disposal in the sink (small amounts of left over food are ok; eggshells and chunks of meat and veggies are not)

12.  Please turn off A/C or heat when leaving the apartment.

13.  As a reminder, we don't allow pets in the condo. Thanks!",,"Lincoln Park is one of the best places to visit when in Chicago.

We want to under promise and over deliver.  So we want to be clear that this property is on Chicago's West side in an amazing multicultural and ethnically diverse neighborhood.  It is, for sure in the inner city.  It's full of grime and glory.  You can't walk to a coffee shop but you can make eye contact and chit chat with a total stranger. Not many places in a big city where that happens anymore.  If you're not used to big cities, do a street view to make sure it's in your comfort zone.  Or, step outside of your comfort zone and have a fantastic new experience.  Isn't that one of the best parts of travel!?

2 minute walk to The Metra. 6 minutes to the CTA which can have you any place in the city.  One of the biggest pluses is our proximity to public transportation.  Also a quick walk to the Chicago DIVY... our fantastic bike share program.  Bike downtown in 15 to 30 minutes depending on location and biking ability.  Uber to either airport for about $15.

You'll feel right at home making coffee and breakfast here before jumping into whatever Chicago adventures you have planned - book today!

You enter our condo into an open living and kitchen space that features bay windows to the street, and a patio door to the shared deck off the kitchen. Our kitchen is recently updated and has plenty of counter space, and there's an in-unit washer and dryer in it. Beyond the living space are two bedrooms, both with queen beds.

Anchored by a beautiful stretch of shoreline to the east and dotted with train stops from two ‘L' lines, Lakeview is one of Chicago's liveliest and most accessible neighborhoods. Several distinct areas — East Lakeview, Central Lakeview, Boystown and Wrigleyville — meld together to form a lakefront community that celebrates diversity and boasts something for every type of visitor.

We're a quick walk to the red line, and just off multiple bus lines. It's only about a half-hour on the CTA to the Loop, and a 15 minute walk to Wrigley Field - you won't have any trouble getting around town without a car from here.","Very simply, please respect my home and my neighbors.

2.) Please ensure you have left the premises and returned any keys issued to you by the agreed upon check out time. Failure to do so will result in a $250 late check-out fee. 
3.) No smoking (of anything) inside the unit or on building premises unless you are in a designated smoking area.  Additionally, Chicago law prohibits smoking within 15 feet of any building entrance. 
4.) Please be respectful of my neighbors and be mindful of noise and loud music. Please observe quiet hours from 10:00 PM-8:00 AM daily.

I own the building and live there as well, so I will meet and greet or a colleague will and I am happy to be of help in any way possible, whether it's assistance in navigating the city or finding the best BYOB restaurant in the neighborhood.

Seriously, I may be biased after having lived here for so many years, but it is the best neighborhood in this great city. We access the whole city in a short time, whether on foot, train or bus and it's outrageously safe. Groceries, restaurants, blues clubs, theaters, etc. are all nearby.
I can't imagine living anywhere else.

The Brown Line EL is a block and a half away, buses are all nearby and if one is a walker, you are at the lake in 15 minutes or on the Magnificent Mile in about 45 minutes on foot.

There are a couple of important rules, the most being there is absolutely no smoking anywhere in or near the building. One of the residents is highly allergic to the smell of nicotine or smoke of any kind. So sorry.

We do ask that people leave their shoes at the door and we provide comfy socks to pad about in. It's a historical landmark, which means all wood joists between floors and so it's a bit noisy with shoes.
We also ask that no candles be lit.

Walking
Many of the city’s top attractions are a short walk or ride away from each other. Weather-permitting, walking is the best way to see the city and the hidden treasures of architecture and public art in the downtown area.
When planning your route, keep in mind that every 8 blocks equals 1 mile.

Chicago Public Transportation (CTA)
The buses and trains of the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) are a fast and cost-effective way to get into and around the city. Known as the “L” (though they may be elevated or underground) the trains are a fun way to see The Loop from a new vantage point.
CTA visitor passes offer the best value, with unlimited rides on all CTA trains and buses. A 1-day pass is $10, a 3-day pass is $20, and a 7-day pass is $28.
Passes are easy to use. They activate the first time you use them and are valid for the number of consecutive days purchased. Just dip your pass into the bus fare machine or the train station turnstile.
Check the CTA website for the latest fares, travel alerts, and trip planners.

Taxis
Taxis are abundant throughout most of Chicago so finding a cab is typically easy. Taxi rates depend on gas prices and number of passengers and can get a bit pricey but provide a fast and convenient way to get around the city, particularly beyond downtown.

Biking
If time and weather permit, consider renting a bike. Chicago’s lakefront boasts 26 uninterrupted miles of easy bike and walking trails.
Half-day rentals are available from Bike and Roll at Navy Pier and Millennium Park.


From the Airports

O’Hare International Airport: 
Chicago’s O’Hare is one of the world’s busiest airports. It’s about 15 miles northwest of the Loop in downtown Chicago. O’Hare has 5 terminals, all of which have information booths and multilingual employees to assist you.

Midway International Airport:
Although it’s smaller than O’Hare, Midway is closer to the Loop and services more discount airlines (but fewer airlines overall). If you’re looking for a good deal on plane tickets, check out flights to Midway.

Private BR w/ comfy bed in charming & eclectic vintage brick building. Located in lovely Hermosa, just west of hip Logan Square.
Although a shared space, you’ll often have the whole apt to yourself. 
Hosted by a 20 yr hospitality vet, you can count on a comfortable stay w/ in-the-know Chicago info.
Cute dog sightings likely :)
**** Snuggle up & relax w/ tube time. Stay in & get work done w/ free WiFi. Go out & explore w/ pro tips! ****

The space is inside a 100 year old vintage brick Chicago style 2 flat. You’ll be in the 2nd floor apartment in a petite & cozy private bedroom including a double bed, closet, and dresser, with access to a kitchen, bathroom, living room, front porch, and backyard.
When not at work, traveling, or spending time exploring the city, your host will likely be downstairs with her mom & dog in the 1st floor apartment. 
Some ideas to get you started...
Lounge with some Netflix or listen to records in the living room. Sip on some  free coffee or read in the nook. Make dinner or get some work done on your laptop in the kitchen. Take a relaxing bath in the bathroom. Sleep, take a nap, & unwind in the bedroom. Explore the city with the help of your host - a Chicago native, hospitality veteran, dog lover, bicyclist, thrifter, yogi, and all-around art enthusiast!

I can always be reached through the Airbnb app, but if it’s more convenient, also by text, phone call, or email. My mom lives in the apartment downstairs & will also be there to help with any issues that may arise if I’m not immediately available. I’ll give you your space, but know that still means I’m dying to give you recommendations so that you can have the best possible time while you’re visiting this great city!

Hermosa is a small, quiet, and family-oriented neighborhood, rich with culture, pride, and history. 
Experience great neighborhood restaurants: tacos at L’Patron, pozole at Pozoleria San Juan, ice cream at La Michoacana, tamales at Chilo Y Chela, donuts at Somethin’ Sweet, and much more! Take a tour of local cidery Right Bee Cider or grab a cocktail at WeeGee’s. Go for a nice walk, run, or bike ride to Kelvyn Park or take the 606 Bloomingdale Trail. Check out the Klairmont Kollections antique car museum. Go creep on Walt Disney’s birthplace. Once you’re through, hop on a bus or grab a car to soak up nearby Logan Square & all of its nightlife, shopping, farmer’s markets, restaurants, theatres, and vibrant scene. 
Bus stops, laundromat, currency exchange, grocery store all within walking distance.

Street parking is free on Kilbourn, Armitage, and surrounding streets, but please watch out for signs. Garage space may be available, so please let me know if it’s needed! Close to Armitage, Fullerton, North, Grand buses heading east & west; Cicero, Pulaski buses heading north & south. If you need a Ventra pass for public transportation, they can be purchased at the currency exchange on Armitage, at Kostner (open 24 hours!). Less than a mile to Bloomingdale Trail Bike/Walk/Run path. Call a taxi ahead or use your Uber or Lyft app to hail a car minutes away!

I have a dog who lives upstairs, so severe allergy sufferers beware. For the most part, he will only be home when I am and he doesn’t spend any time in the guest bedroom. He is excessively sweet, but might jump because he’s just so excited to see you!","• Please be sure to close outside gates behind you so my dog Oscar doesn’t escape! 
• Please be aware that this space is my home. My own toiletries will be in the bathroom & food in the kitchen. However, I have provided a few toiletries & food items for your convenience that are clearly labeled or listed in the app. If you forgot something I didn’t provide, just ask :) 
I may have something to share or a recommendation on where you can easily find it. 
• No extra guests at the house unless you have cleared it with me at the time of booking.
• This is a safe space, free of judgement, where respectful & tolerant behavior & speech will be practiced by your host and expected from guests.
• Don’t get your apps confused. Please remember this is Airbnb, not Tinder. Advances will not be tolerated. 
• In the interest of cleanliness & bug prevention, please keep meals at the kitchen table & wash dishes upon use. 
• Due to only one bathroom being available for both of us, please let me know if you plan to get up & get ready between 7 and 930am so that we can come up with a plan. 
• Tell me the name of your favorite city so I know you’ve read these rules ;)

Very close to the Damen Blue Line stop (about 5 minute walk). Also right between the North Ave. bus and the Milwaukee bus lines and near the Damen bus line.

We do have 2 indoor cats so you just need to watch for them and make sure not to leave doors to the outside open.

building in a perfect location with amazing city views in every direction through its floor to ceiling windows. It's a spacious two bedroom and two bathroom apartment with an additional day bed and sofa sleeper, ideal for families or couples traveling together. You can easily reach anything you want to see in the city from here. I'm always happy to give recommendations!

Located in a secure, luxury building in the center of it all! Once you're inside, you're greeted by floor-to-ceiling windows on every wall. The views during the day are incredible - but it's even more magical at night! Right out the window, you'll see a unique scene of diverse and historic Chicago architecture with the bustling city below. 

Everything is top of line and interior design is a passion of mine - so the furnishing of the unit reflects that! There is blazing fast internet, a smart TV with Roku, and comfortable modern furniture to lounge on. 

The kitchen and living room are open and each of the two bedrooms has its own luxury bathroom.

The kitchen is stocked with top of the line cookware and all the tools you need to stay in and cook a great meal if you wish. 

Plus - we have a 6 person dining room table and 3 counter stools for the kitchen island. Plenty of room for all guests to dine comfortably. 

For each guest, the comfortable beds have fresh, clean and crisp linens and the bathrooms are stocked with fresh towels and bath products from Malin + Goetz. 

I also provide towels and detergent, iron etc. and you have full access to the in-unit washer and dryer!

You will have complete and private access to our condo.

From our location, you can easily walk to Millennium Park, the lakefront, the Chicago River, the Magnificent Mile, the Art Institute and so much more. The Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, and Soldier Field are just a 5 minute ride. Oak Street for luxury shopping and the West Loop restaurant row for would class dining are only 5 minutes away as well!

Our place is surrounded by trains and buses that will take you anywhere in the city you want to go! Uber and Lyft is also available 24/7. You'll have no trouble getting around without a car.

Parking is not included with our listing, but there are many nearby parking garages close to our building (within a couple blocks).

Bucktown and Wicker Park are practically inseparable—the districts bleed into each other so seamlessly, it’s hard to know where one ends and the other begins. The neighborhoods have been the focus of two decades of steady development, and even as they become more accessible to young families and professionals, the neighborhoods maintain an innovative vibe. Thanks to established cultural institutions, walkable strips of galleries, boutiques, bars, and restaurants, Wicker Park and Bucktown continue to be a destination for creative types - and anyone looking for a nice time.

The Western Blue Line stop is about a half-mile / 10 minute walk south. The 49/Western and 74/Fullerton buses are nearby too, so it's easy to get around here without a car. If you do bring a car, however, there's plenty of street parking in the neighborhood.","House Rules: Very simply, please respect my home and my neighbors.

You have access to the whole upstairs, which includes two bedrooms, living room, kitchen, bathroom, back porch, and driveway. We share the backyard, but you'll have a private back entrance, and your porch space is far above everything.

We like to respect our guests privacy, so you have your own entrance through the backyard. However, you might run into us  in the garden or on our lower level of the back porch! Feel free to ask any questions, or keep to yourselves-- Whatever you prefer for an enjoyable stay.

Logan Square is full of cafes, restaurants, bars, breweries, galleries & parks! Literally anything you could need is right here within a 10min walk-- maybe even a 2min walk! It has been a thriving artistic community for a long time, and has grown into somewhat of a destination spot in recent years because of its creative flair and bustling life, with a neighborhood feel.

It is easiest to get to us from O'hare-- about a 30min train ride straight from the inside of the airport to the California stop, only 1.5 blocks from the house! If you're coming from Midway, we are a very close highway, so Uber or Lyft makes that about a 40min drive-- or you could take the Orange Line to Clark/Lake, where you'll transfer to the Blue Line (headed to O'hare), and get off at the California Stop. This option takes about an hour.

Please let us know if you are driving/have a car, so we can make sure the driveway is available for your use. We live in the unit directly below you, and so we are of course understanding of normal noise levels with upstairs guests. But please try to refrain from shoes inside, stomping, moving furniture, and loud bass, for our benefit. Thank you!","We live right below on the 1st floor, so we have quiet hours set from 10:30pm-9am.

 I want to preface the following by saying 95% of our guests leave our places in amazing condition. We are very understanding about small messes that may have been overlooked as I know I am by no means perfect. That being said the following is to address the 5% who may not understand quite how airbnb works yet.  

1. We are not a hotel.  
2. We are not your personal maids.   

While there is a cleaning fee, the fee is to cover changing of linens, washing of towels and ""normal"" cleaning of the kitchen, bathroom and living areas. What is not covered and WILL incur an extra fee are the following:   

1. A pile of dishes left in the sink (violates house rules)
2. Excessive kitchen messes such as cooking grease all over the stove. 
3. Excessive food on the floors (I dont mean a few crumbs-I mean it looked like someone was feeding pigeons). 
4. Chewing gum ground into the furniture (yes, that has actually happened). 
5. OBVIOUS wearing of shoes in the unit (we are a no-shoes house- see house rules) ie shoes foot prints, tracked in dirt and mud. 
 Anything else above and beyond what is considered ""normal"" cleaning.  
6. smoking in the unit will AUTOMATICALLY  incur a $200 fee.  
7. NO PETS. We have other units available that allow pets. please contact me about them. $100 fee if pets are found staying in the unit without prior consent.    

Again- this ISNT the majority of our guests and we understand things can be overlooked. Upon an ""excessive cleaning"" situation, I will not leave any review, I will simply send a request for an extra cleaning fee (usually around $25-50) depending on how much extra time it took to clean.

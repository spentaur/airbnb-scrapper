Just east of Downtown Chicago, the upscale suburb of Oak Brook is known for its rolling golf courses, high-end shopping, and concentration of corporate headquarters that draw visitors from around the world.

Within a short drive of the apartment, golfers can go for holes-in-one at Butterfield Country Club, Butler National Golf Club, Chicago Highlands Club, Fresh Meadow Golf Club, and more. These country clubs are also known for their banquet and social event facilities.

Golf courses aren’t the only places to relax around here; don’t miss the beautiful Morton Arboretum, known for hiking and biking trails and summertime picnic spots. The Danada Forest Preserve is home to lush parkland and the Danada House, a popular wedding venue. Craving a delicious meal? Don’t miss Oak Brook’s impressive dining scene, which features high-end steakhouses like Michael Jordan’s Restaurant and The Capital Grille.

When the Windy City weather takes a turn, head inside to the plethora of leisure attractions in the Oak Brook area. Shopaholics from around the Chicago metro head to the Oakbrook Center for stores like Restoration Hardware, Apple, and Louis Vuitton. It’s anchored by Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Macy’s, and Sears. In addition to the AMC Theatre at this mall, movie buffs can also catch the latest blockbusters at the AMC Dine-In at Yorktown Center, about 5 minutes from the apartment by car.

Oak Brook also means business; a plethora of national and global corporations have headquarters here. The head offices of Kellogg’s, RedBox, Ace Hardware, Microsoft, and more are within a few minutes’ drive.

Of course, no Chicago trip is complete without a selfie in front of the Bean or a slice of deep dish pizza. If you’re heading into Downtown Chi-Town, our apartment has easy freeway access, which makes accessing the city center a breeze.

While taking the L train is the best way to get around Downtown, we recommend driving to get to the highlights of Oak Brook. The apartment has free, secure parking - as does nearly every business, restaurant, and venue in Oak Brook.

If you’re flying into Chi-Town, we recommend renting a car and driving to the apartment. We’re a short drive from both O’Hare International Airport (about 20 minutes) and Midway (about 25 minutes).

Downtown Chicago is about a 30-minute drive from the apartment, depending on traffic. Keep in mind that traffic may increase during rush hour. If you’re heading into town for drinks, Uber and Lyft are available throughout the Chicago metro.

Logan Square is one of the friendliest and booming neighborhoods in Chicago with plenty of nightlife options on every corner. The Beatle house is within two blocks of Revolution Brewery, Logan Bar, Cole's, The Boiler Room and a host of other hot spots (and for mornings - 3 blocks south is the much loved Cozy Corner Diner for pancakes, skillets, bacon and eggs).  Vegetarians & Vegans will enjoy the highly
lauded Chicago Diner, right around the corner from the house.  I'm just a few blocks from The Logan Theater, a restored vintage movie theater and comedy showcase room with it's own bar , and on the corner from the theater there's no ""banker with a motorcar"", but you will see an actual barber shop called Penny Lane : )

Public trans (Blue Line train and street buses) are within two blocks.  You can get downtown within 20 minutes and the blue line train will get you out to O'Hare International Airport within 35 minutes.

We strive to maintain the absolute highest standard of service on Airbnb. However, we are not a 5-star hotel and are therefore unable to provide everything that you would expect from a hotel. If you have specific things that you are very picky about, please discuss with us before booking.

Due to changing regulations on Airbnb in Chicago, we must ask that you maintain discretion with building staff. Please do not approach them with any requests. Definitely do not approach them to collect keys or to “check-in.”

Once you arrive, we will ask you to follow our house rules. Please read these rules carefully and take them seriously. Failure to comply can result in forfeiture of your deposit and termination of your reservation without a refund.

- This building is 100% non-smoking. No smoking or vaping of anything inside the unit or on building premises. Chicago law prohibits smoking within 15 feet of any building entrance.
- This a quiet and upscale residential building. Please observe quiet hours from 10:00 PM - 8:00 AM daily. Our neighbors are very sensitive and they will report loud noise. Any noise disturbances reported by neighbors or police will result in forfeiture of partial or full deposit.
- Absolutely no guests not in the reservation are allowed in the apartment or the building common areas.
- No pets allowed unless approved. Bringing in a pet without notice or approval will result in a forfeiture of partial or full deposit.
- Please ensure you have left the premises and returned any keys issued to you by the agreed-upon check out time. Failure to do so will result in a $250 late check out fee.
- Lockouts will result in a $150 fee per occurrence.

Everything you need is right outside your doorstep! Downtown Chicago is a city with an appetite—for food, of course, but also for design, history, and culture. Come here to marvel at the cutting-edge architecture or take in the gorgeous views of Lake Michigan; to spend a day cheering with baseball fans and a night laughing at a comedy show; to shop, to visit renowned institutions like the Field Museum, The Art Institute and the Adler Planetarium, and to experience the legendary blues scene. To do all this, you'll need nourishment: taste deep-dish pizza, piled-high hot dogs, Italian beef sandwiches, and more.

This spacious 2BR/2BA is near Chicago’s biggest corporate headquarters, high-end shopping, and fantastic restaurants of the upscale Oak Brook suburb. This brand-new development boasts luxurious amenities like a gym and resort-style outdoor pool. The community also has 24/7 security and free parking. Get the best of urban living and residential comfort just a short drive from Downtown Chicago and O’Hare.

After a busy day of meetings or retail therapy, retreat to your own swanky residence in the new Lakeside Village of Oak Brook community. Enjoy being one of the development’s first tenants and among the lucky few Chicago visitors to enjoy perks like a refreshing outdoor pool and state-of-the-art fitness center. You also get to park for free - you won’t find that Downtown!

This 2-bedroom apartment can comfortably sleep 6, with two private bedrooms and plenty of space. One bedroom features a queen-size bed, and the other bedroom has 2 queen-size beds. If you did some shopping at the upscale Oakbrook Center (7-minute drive away), home to stores like Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, you’ll find plenty of closet space to store your finds.

Two bathrooms ensure everybody has privacy with modern fixtures worthy of a five-star hotel. For your comfort and convenience, we provide all towels, linens, toiletries, a hair dryer, and an iron. 

If you’re traveling on business, maybe to visit the nearby corporate headquarters of Microsoft, Ace Hardware, or Kellogg’s, you’ll be happy to know the apartment includes homey amenities like a full kitchen and a spacious living room. Cook up some breakfast in the kitchen, which features modern appliances and all the dishes, serveware, and utensils you’d need. And when the day is done, kick back and relax on the couch.

Or if your Windy City trip is a family vacation or getaway with friends, the apartment is the perfect place to spend time with loved ones. Hang out around the dining table with some Chicago craft beers and deep dish pizza, or just chat for hours in the living room.

Families love our residential location for the quiet, safe atmosphere - the community has on-site security 24/7 and you won’t hear any of the typical city noises. And if you’re in town for a social event, you’ll be in close proximity to the numerous wedding venues, banquet halls, golf courses, country clubs, and restaurants of Oak Brook.

Besides the apartment itself, you’ll have access to the spectacular amenities of the Lakeside Village development. In the summer, take advantage of the sparkling outdoor pool and the picnic area, and in the winter, cozy up to the fireplace in the resident lounge or get some exercise in the fitness center.

We’re all about giving you plenty of privacy and personal space, so we’ll be available by phone (call or text) during your stay.

Just east of Downtown Chicago, the upscale suburb of Oak Brook is known for its rolling golf courses, high-end shopping, and concentration of corporate headquarters that draw visitors from around the world.

Within a short drive of the apartment, golfers can go for holes-in-one at Butterfield Country Club, Butler National Golf Club, Chicago Highlands Club, Fresh Meadow Golf Club, and more. These country clubs are also known for their banquet and social event facilities.

Golf courses aren’t the only places to relax around here; don’t miss the beautiful Morton Arboretum, known for hiking and biking trails and summertime picnic spots. The Danada Forest Preserve is home to lush parkland and the Danada House, a popular wedding venue. Craving a delicious meal? Don’t miss Oak Brook’s impressive dining scene, which features high-end steakhouses like Michael Jordan’s Restaurant and The Capital Grille.

When the Windy City weather takes a turn, head inside to the plethora of leisure attractions in the Oak Brook area. Shopaholics from around the Chicago metro head to the Oakbrook Center for stores like Restoration Hardware, Apple, and Louis Vuitton. It’s anchored by Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Macy’s, and Sears. In addition to the AMC Theatre at this mall, movie buffs can also catch the latest blockbusters at the AMC Dine-In at Yorktown Center, about 5 minutes from the apartment by car.

Oak Brook also means business; a plethora of national and global corporations have headquarters here. The head offices of Kellogg’s, RedBox, Ace Hardware, Microsoft, and more are within a few minutes’ drive.

Of course, no Chicago trip is complete without a selfie in front of the Bean or a slice of deep dish pizza. If you’re heading into Downtown Chi-Town, our apartment has easy freeway access, which makes accessing the city center a breeze.

While taking the L train is the best way to get around Downtown, we recommend driving to get to the highlights of Oak Brook. The apartment has free, secure parking - as does nearly every business, restaurant, and venue in Oak Brook.

If you’re flying into Chi-Town, we recommend renting a car and driving to the apartment. We’re a short drive from both O’Hare International Airport (about 20 minutes) and Midway (about 25 minutes).

Downtown Chicago is about a 30-minute drive from the apartment, depending on traffic. Keep in mind that traffic may increase during rush hour. If you’re heading into town for drinks, Uber and Lyft are available throughout the Chicago metro.

We're located in Lakeview, one of Chicago's safest and most popular neighborhoods.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

1. “How do I get to ‘x’ from the apartment?/How far is the apartment from ‘x’?”

Excellent public transit directions from our apartment to any point in the city are available via web search. Our building is just a short walk from the Belmont “L” train station. Search for “Belmont red line station” in Maps, click the “Directions” button, then enter your point of interest.

Parking in Chicago is always difficult and even more so in the evening and during special events. We recommend using an app called SpotHero to reserve a nearby paid parking spot. We love SpotHero because it allows you to reserve a parking spot in advance so that you don’t have to worry about finding one the day you arrive.

3. When is check-in/check-out?

Well, now’s your chance to bring that fantasy to life. During your stay, the whole apartment is yours and only yours. 

But that’s not all! You’ll also have access to the building’s gym (open 24/7 and stocked with cardio machines and weights) and lobby lounge area. The building’s common spaces and your unit are accessible via elevator.","Cubs fans, deep-dish fans, and history fans unite! Chicago is a fabulous getaway city for any interest, and our spacious studio apartment is the ideal place to stay while you’re here. Featuring modern decor, a full kitchen, and access to a 24/7 gym, your time in Chi-Town will be comfortable and convenient. 

Our place is just a 5-minute walk to two CTA stations that will take you Downtown or north to Loyola or Evanston. And our walkable neighborhood has theaters, parks, and lots of good eats.

In the heart of trendy Uptown Chicago, our sophisticated studio apartment is the perfect launchpad for Windy City adventures or clinching that important business deal. Whatever brings you to town, you’ll rest easy in our charming, quiet neighborhood with easy access to the Red Line train to take you south to Downtown or north to Loyola and Evanston.

Illuminated by sunny natural light, our studio features a Queen-size bed, premium linens, and plenty of closet space so you can unpack and forget about your suitcase for a while. Enjoy the privacy of your own room, with doors that close and independently controlled air-conditioning units.

The apartment includes one full bathroom, with a shower, sink, and toilet. We’re all about helping you look (and smell) your best, so we provide shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in addition to hand soap and fluffy towels. Trust us when we say there’s no better way to warm up after a Windy City walk than a hot shower!

There’s ample space for everyone to relax in our studio. Like the rest of the unit, you’ll live it up in luxury among hardwood floors and contemporary decor. 

Whether you’re craving a home-cooked meal or just somewhere to put the box of deep-dish, our kitchen is fully stocked with cookware, dishes, utensils, and has swanky granite countertops. Appliances include a full-sized fridge and freezer, gas stove, oven, microwave, toaster, and coffee maker. A nice space cozy bathroom with shower (half shower door) complete with basic bath essentials. The only things missing are your favorite farmer’s market finds!

And as a building resident, feel free to use the gym (open 24/7 in case the urge to work out strikes at any time), do a load or two in the laundry room, and kick back in the lobby. Pro tip: the laundry room operates on a BYOQ system - that’s Bring Your Own Quarters.

Ever dreamed about jetting off to your own Chicago apartment? Well, now’s your chance to bring that fantasy to life. During your stay, the whole apartment is yours and only yours. 

But that’s not all! You’ll also have access to the building’s gym (open 24/7 and stocked with cardio machines and weights) and lobby lounge area. The building’s common spaces and your unit are accessible via elevator.

We’re all about giving you plenty of privacy and personal space, so we’ll be available by phone (call or text) during your stay.

If you’re searching for Chicago history and culture, but you also want to get a good night’s sleep without the non-stop noise of Downtown, Uptown is your ‘hood. Uptown is slightly north of Downtown, and just a mile west of Montrose Beach and Lake Shore Drive. It’s safe, a little historic, a little trendy, and a perfect home base for any Chi-Town getaway. Our apartment is within walking distance of coffee shops (including a Starbucks), banks, and grocery stores.

More information

This hip neighborhood features old-school Chicago gems like the famed Riviera Theatre, the much-loved Fat Cat Restaurant & Bar, and easy access to Wrigley Field and Downtown via the Red Line from Lawrence Station. With plenty of good restaurants, vibrant bars, and exciting venues, you might find yourself not even wanting to venture downtown!

Some of our favorite nearby restaurants include Fat Cat, where you can indulge in tasty pub grub over a game of pool, and Demera, an Ethiopian restaurant serving top-notch coffee shareable small plates. Fat Cat is only a 2-minute walk from our place, and Demera is a 5-minute walk at most. Need a coffee fix in a hurry? There’s a Starbucks across the street from Demera, in the Bridgeview Bank Building.

Searching for some more global cuisine? Argyle Street, just 5 minutes by foot north of our building, is home to some of Chicago’s best Vietnamese restaurants. We love Tank Noodle, Nha Hang, and for dessert, La Patisserie P. Chinese fare is also popular on Argyle Street, like Chiu Quon Bakery (try the authentic egg tarts!) and the Hong Kong-inspired Sun Wah BBQ.

How about an adult beverage at the end of the day? Uptown has no shortage of nightlife, and one must-visit watering hole is the famed live music hotspot The Green Mill. Nearly every night of the week, you’ll find local or touring artists from the full spectrum of genres. Another classic music venue is the Riviera Theatre, which has been dazzling patrons since 1917. The Riviera is only a 5-minute walk from our apartment, as is the storied Aragon Ballroom. Aragon’s intimate theatre is the perfect place to see a show without the massive crowds of an arena concert. 

Baseball fans will be happy to know that our apartment is only a 7-minute L ride from Wrigley Field - just take the Red Line from Lawrence to Addison. Now that’s what we call a home run location! Sorry, we had to. Also a short walk from Addison Station is the 1920s-era Music Box Theatre, which now screens a fascinating variety of indie and international films.

Continue a few more stops on the Red Line, and you’ll enter Downtown Chicago, home to attractions like the Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, and the mirrored Bean sculpture (whose real name is actually Cloud Gate). If you’re traveling with kids, don’t miss the Shedd Aquarium The ride is only about 20 minutes from Lawrence station, and during rush hour, you’ll avoid traffic by taking the L. 

But Downtown Chicago isn’t the only other neighborhood worth exploring; from our convenient Uptown location, Lakeview and Boystown are both easy accessible. From Wellington Station (about 10 minutes south on the Red Line), don’t miss the crispy Korean-style fried chicken at Crisp or a show at the 100-year-old Vic Theatre.

Unless you’re really into parallel parking or overpriced meters, we recommend using public transportation to explore Chi-town. Our place is just a 5-minute walk to both the Argyle and Lawrence stations, where you can catch the Red Line. The Red Line will take you straight to Wrigley Field (7 minutes), or keep on riding for about 15 more minutes to access the best of Downtown. Grant/State Station is most convenient to the tasty restaurants of River North, and Lake Station puts you just 3 blocks from the Bean. P.S. Locals call the subway the “L.”

Public transit is also an easy way to get to our place from O’Hare Airport, especially during rush hour. Hop on the Blue Line at the airport, and switch to the #51 bus at the Jefferson Park Transit Center. You’ll go from baggage claim to beautiful condo in only an hour!

If ridesharing is more your style, Uber and Lyft are available throughout the Chicago metro. Keep in mind that traffic can pile up Downtown during major events or rush hour, which usually makes fares increase. Another reason why we love the L!

***WIFI service is an open connection provided by the building management and is in the works of upgrading it. Outages may be experienced from time to time while the upgrade is on going. As of this moment, the service is NOT SUITABLE for remote work and can only cater mobile/portable devices.

We highly recommend keeping your key fob in a safe place, because if you lose it, you’ll lose access to the entire building. Not fun. It takes time to replace it, which means you might be locked out of the building and the apartment for a while, and any fob replacement will incur a fee of $300. That’s probably not what you have in mind for a “memorable” trip to Chicago, so let’s just keep track of the fob.

Our apartment includes lots of awesome amenities, but it does NOT include a parking space. If you need to park a vehicle, there is some metered street parking nearby. We recommend using the Spot Hero app to claim a street parking space. The city is easily accessible with public transit and ride sharing, so having your own set of wheels isn’t necessary unless you plan on exploring far outside the city limits.

We highly recommend keeping your key fob in a safe place, because if you lose it, you’ll lose access to the entire building. Not fun. It takes time to replace it, which means you might be locked out of the building and the apartment for a while, and any fob replacement will incur a fee of $300. That’s probably not what you have in mind for a “memorable” trip to Chicago, so let’s just keep track of the fob.

Our apartment includes lots of awesome amenities, but it does NOT include a parking space. If you need to park a vehicle, there is some metered street parking nearby. We recommend using the Spot Hero app to claim a street parking space. The city is easily accessible with public transit and ride sharing, so having your own set of wheels isn’t necessary unless you plan on exploring far outside the city limits.

-Bath towels are provided per number of guest not per number of stay
-Washcloths are not provided during your stay. You may send me a message though if you need them and I'll try my best to accommodate your request.
-We have duvet covers on our beddings  (no top sheets).
-A Security Deposit may be required on some bookings. 
-If there's an issue during your stay, please report it real time so we can address it right away.

Thank you for understanding, and we look forward to hosting you in beautiful Uptown Chicago!","In the heart of trendy Uptown Chicago, our sophisticated studio apartment is the perfect launchpad for Windy City adventures or clinching that important business deal. Whatever brings you to town, you’ll rest easy in our charming, quiet neighborhood with easy access to the Red Line train to take you south to Downtown or north to Loyola and Evanston.

Illuminated by sunny natural light, our studio features a Queen-size bed, premium linens, and plenty of closet space so you can unpack and forget about your suitcase for a while. Enjoy the privacy of your own room, with doors that close and independently controlled air-conditioning units.

The apartment includes one full bathroom, with a shower, sink, and toilet. We’re all about helping you look (and smell) your best, so we provide shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in addition to hand soap and fluffy towels. Trust us when we say there’s no better way to warm up after a Windy City walk than a hot shower!

There’s ample space for everyone to relax in our studio. Like the rest of the unit, you’ll live it up in luxury among hardwood floors and contemporary decor. 

Whether you’re craving a home-cooked meal or just somewhere to put the box of deep-dish, our kitchen is fully stocked with cookware, dishes, utensils, and has swanky granite countertops. Appliances include a full-sized fridge and freezer, gas stove, oven, microwave, toaster, and coffee maker. A nice space cozy bathroom with shower (half shower door) complete with basic bath essentials. The only things missing are your favorite farmer’s market finds!

And as a building resident, feel free to use the gym (open 24/7 in case the urge to work out strikes at any time), do a load or two in the laundry room, and kick back in the lobby. Pro tip: the laundry room operates on a BYOQ system - that’s Bring Your Own Quarters.","Cubs fans, deep-dish fans, and history fans unite! Chicago is a fabulous getaway city for any interest, and our spacious studio apartment is the ideal place to stay while you’re here. Featuring modern decor, a full kitchen, and access to a 24/7 gym, your time in Chi-Town will be comfortable and convenient. 

Our place is just a 5-minute walk to two CTA stations that will take you Downtown or north to Loyola or Evanston. And our walkable neighborhood has theaters, parks, and lots of good eats.","Unless you’re really into parallel parking or overpriced meters, we recommend using public transportation to explore Chi-town. Our place is just a 5-minute walk to both the Argyle and Lawrence stations, where you can catch the Red Line. The Red Line will take you straight to Wrigley Field (7 minutes), or keep on riding for about 15 more minutes to access the best of Downtown. Grant/State Station is most convenient to the tasty restaurants of River North, and Lake Station puts you just 3 blocks from the Bean. P.S. Locals call the subway the “L.”

Public transit is also an easy way to get to our place from O’Hare Airport, especially during rush hour. Hop on the Blue Line at the airport, and switch to the #51 bus at the Jefferson Park Transit Center. You’ll go from baggage claim to beautiful condo in only an hour!

If ridesharing is more your style, Uber and Lyft are available throughout the Chicago metro. Keep in mind that traffic can pile up Downtown during major events or rush hour, which usually makes fares increase.

Walking
Many of the city’s top attractions are a short walk or ride away from each other. Weather-permitting, walking is the best way to see the city and the hidden treasures of architecture and public art in the downtown area.
When planning your route, keep in mind that every 8 blocks equals 1 mile.

Chicago Public Transportation (CTA)
The buses and trains of the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) are a fast and cost-effective way to get into and around the city. Known as the “L” (though they may be elevated or underground) the trains are a fun way to see The Loop from a new vantage point.
CTA visitor passes offer the best value, with unlimited rides on all CTA trains and buses. A 1-day pass is $10, a 3-day pass is $20, and a 7-day pass is $28.
Passes are easy to use. They activate the first time you use them and are valid for the number of consecutive days purchased. Just dip your pass into the bus fare machine or the train station turnstile.
Check the CTA website for the latest fares, travel alerts, and trip planners.

Taxis
Taxis are abundant throughout most of Chicago so finding a cab is typically easy. Taxi rates depend on gas prices and number of passengers and can get a bit pricey but provide a fast and convenient way to get around the city, particularly beyond downtown.

Biking
If time and weather permit, consider renting a bike. Chicago’s lakefront boasts 26 uninterrupted miles of easy bike and walking trails.
Half-day rentals are available from Bike and Roll at Navy Pier and Millennium Park.


From the Airports

O’Hare International Airport: 
Chicago’s O’Hare is one of the world’s busiest airports. It’s about 15 miles northwest of the Loop in downtown Chicago. O’Hare has 5 terminals, all of which have information booths and multilingual employees to assist you.

Midway International Airport:
Although it’s smaller than O’Hare, Midway is closer to the Loop and services more discount airlines (but fewer airlines overall). If you’re looking for a good deal on plane tickets, check out flights to Midway.

Walking
Many of the city’s top attractions are a short walk or ride away from each other. Weather-permitting, walking is the best way to see the city and the hidden treasures of architecture and public art in the downtown area.
When planning your route, keep in mind that every 8 blocks equals 1 mile.

Chicago Public Transportation (CTA)
The buses and trains of the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) are a fast and cost-effective way to get into and around the city. Known as the “L” (though they may be elevated or underground) the trains are a fun way to see The Loop from a new vantage point.
CTA visitor passes offer the best value, with unlimited rides on all CTA trains and buses. A 1-day pass is $10, a 3-day pass is $20, and a 7-day pass is $28.
Passes are easy to use. They activate the first time you use them and are valid for the number of consecutive days purchased. Just dip your pass into the bus fare machine or the train station turnstile.
Check the CTA website for the latest fares, travel alerts, and trip planners.

Taxis
Taxis are abundant throughout most of Chicago so finding a cab is typically easy. Taxi rates depend on gas prices and number of passengers and can get a bit pricey but provide a fast and convenient way to get around the city, particularly beyond downtown.

Biking
If time and weather permit, consider renting a bike. Chicago’s lakefront boasts 26 uninterrupted miles of easy bike and walking trails.
Half-day rentals are available from Bike and Roll at Navy Pier and Millennium Park.


From the Airports

O’Hare International Airport: 
Chicago’s O’Hare is one of the world’s busiest airports. It’s about 15 miles northwest of the Loop in downtown Chicago. O’Hare has 5 terminals, all of which have information booths and multilingual employees to assist you.

Midway International Airport:
Although it’s smaller than O’Hare, Midway is closer to the Loop and services more discount airlines (but fewer airlines overall).

We can interact as much or as little as you want.  I travel frequently, so even if I'm not here, you can always reach out to me for anything you may need.  The best way to reach me is through airbnb messaging.  If I'm around I'd be happy to show you around or just leave you alone :-).

Located in downtown Chicago's Loop, the area has a reputation for being eclectic and interesting, artistic and tightly-woven. Walking distance to Chicago's bustling business district, shopping, dining, culture, and entertainment.  2 miles from McCormick Place.  Here is a list of my favorite restaurants, cultural centers, and entertainment venues all within walking distance of the apartment:
Restaurants - Mercata a la Planxa, Hackney's, Giocco, Umai, South Loop Club, Blackie's, Chicago Firehouse Restaurant, Lou Malnati's, Buddy Guy's Legends
Culture/Entertainment - Willis (Sears) Tower, Lake Michigan, Soldier Field, Museum Campus (Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium), Buckingham Fountain, Art Institute of Chicago, ShowPlace ICON Movie Theatre, Chicago Cultural Center, Oriental Theatre, Petrillo Music Shell, Harris Theatre, Auditorium Theatre at Roosevelt University, Chicago Theatre, Pritzker Music Pavilion, Goodman Theatre, Symphony Center.

If you can avoid having a car, I recommend it. If not, your best option will be to download an app such as SpotHero or ParkWhiz to find discounted spots in parking lots throughout the area. If using public transportation, Chicago's public train system called The L is the best way to get around.

The building does not have a parking garage available to guests. I recommend using an app, such as SpotHero, to find discounted parking nearby. If you're driving to Chicago, but won't be using your car during your stay, parking somewhere further north around Lincoln Park or further South around the South Loop is definitely your best option!","*Please note that we do not allow bookings from residents of Chicago and surrounding areas*

Within four blocks on Roscoe Street (between Claremont and Damen), there is a mecca of restaurants, boutiques, salons, coffee shops, a liquor store, several bars and taverns, dry cleaners, flower shop, a big thrift store and a fine independent bookstore.

Bus and the L (Elevated Train)
You can catch the Western Avenue bus (no. 49 and 49Xpress) at the corner of Roscoe and Western. You will need correct change for the bus: $2.25.

If you want to go downtown take the 49 or 49X bus north to the Brown Line ""Western"" L stop (you'll see the elevated tracks) at Western & Lincoln Ave. Once on the L, it's a 20-30 minute ride to downtown Chicago, depending on time of day.

Or, if you want to cut out the bus link (as I do), you can walk 15 minutes east (towards the lake) on Roscoe Street to the Brown Line ""Paulina"" stop. The L station is where Roscoe Street, Lincoln Ave., and Paulina cross. Look for the elevated tracks and the station is nearby on Lincoln Avenue.

Divvy Bikes - short term city bike rental. Bikes can be deposited at any depot.
There's a depot just around the corner on Roscoe. Rental information is posted there.

Chicago River Canoe & Kayak: You are a short ten minute walk from the river (head west on Roscoe). The boat rental is at Roscoe and Rockwell, housed in the beautiful boathouse there designed by the renowned architect, Jeanne Gang.

But on the two other street of each corner of the street where the building is you can park for free as well

The room is private but you will share common areas ( kitchen , living room, and the bathroom/s) with other Airbnb guests.

This is a good option if you want to save even more money otherwise you can book two rooms! 
As most houses in United States this is not made with concrete so you will hear people walking or outside sounds. It doesn’t bother most of the guest but if you are a very light sleeper maybe you should choose an entire place. or have an earphone or something to block the sound.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

1. “How do I get to ‘x’ from the apartment?/How far is the apartment from ‘x’?”

Excellent public transit directions from our apartment to any point in the city are available via web search. Our building is just a short walk from the Belmont “L” train station. Search for “Belmont red line station” in Maps, click the “Directions” button, then enter your point of interest.

Parking in Chicago is always difficult and even more so in the evening and during special events. We recommend using an app called SpotHero to reserve a nearby paid parking spot.

"1) Check in is from 5-10PM. I can not greet guests before 5PM or after 10PM, so don’t even ask. If you arrive at 10:01PM, I will not be available to greet you under any circumstances because 10:01 is after 10PM. 
2) Check out is at 11:00AM.
3) Please read the itinerary that AirBnB will send you upon booking. The address and wifi information is on there. 
4) Read the signs as far as parking and yes, it's free and available. Don’t park on the South side of the street because that’s permit parking only. 
5) If you book the room for safety reasons I would prefer (meaning require) to greet you and hand you the keys, not your guests. 
6) I've found it best to communicate with guests only through the Airbnb message thread because it helps me remember guests' questions. So please talk to me through that Airbnb message thread only. 
7) If keys get lost I must charge $50 to replace them. 
8) Please wash, dry, and put away dirty dishes. If dishes are left out, I must charge a $20 fee. 
9) Before you check out please empty the garbages in each room and in the kitchen and take the garbage bag around to the back yard and place it in the larger garbage cans. Then place a clean garbage bag in the garbage can in the kitchen. Again, if this isn't done or if it's left in the back hallway then I must charge $20. 
10) Please tell me a day in advanced what time in between the hours of 5-10 you will be arriving. 
11) Be sure to have a current profile pic of yourselves that allows me to clearly see your face and not, say, you in a paintball mask or at age 10. 
12) If glitter is found in the house, you must pay $100, just cuz taking all that time to get glitter out of everywhere is redounkulous and I don’t have that time. 
13) Please be sure to upload a Gov ID to Airbnb’s website before sending a reservation request.

Maybe 5 guests, but they must sleep on the couch.","Five minutes from the train station, which is 15 min from the city center. Great, lively neighborhood. Street parking is free and available. Downtown Pilsen is an up and coming artist neighborhood in Chicago. It has a 50"" HD TV, Bluetooth 30 watt sound bar, Amazon Fire Stick, and wifi with 75MB, so it's fast. Lastly, I can not check-in guests early or late so please don’t even ask.

The apartment has two bedrooms with two full size beds in each room. The back room is 8.5 feet by 7.5 ft.(2.60meters by 2.3 m), the front room is 9 ft. by 8 ft. (2.74m by 2.4m), and the bathroom is 7.5 ft. by 7.5 ft. (2.3m by 2.3m) including measuring the shower area. Each room has a closet, space heater, and towels. The kitchen has cook ware, dishes, and silverware. If you need something I don't have to cook with tell me and I'll go get it. The bathroom is on the smaller side. In an area in the hallway the floor is slightly damaged, but it's easy to avoid. Be sure to click on the picture to see the entire picture and then you’ll see it circled on the lower right hand corner of the pic. If you have 5 guests please keep in mind that the fifth person will have to sleep on the couch and the couch is not a hide a bed, couch. 

And you should know that before every guest arrives I clean thoroughly, including the bathroom. I use a drill brush (and sometimes a sponge) in the bathtub and bathtub tile, scrub around and on the toilet, sink, and windex the mirrors, and sweep the floor so it’s not going to get any cleaner. If there’s an off-white tinge to the bathtub area that’s a stain and not because it’s dirty. 

Parking is free. Be sure to read the signs to know if street cleaning will be arriving. They usually come from the month of November every 4th Monday between the hours of 7AM-9AM, or something like that. If you're driving and would prefer to drive to The Loop instead of paying for the train, then be sure to download the app, ""Parkwhiz"" or ""SpotHero.(URL HIDDEN)
I like to interact with guests. You will be given your own set of keys to the building and apartment and can come and go as you please. 

It's at a great location with restauraunts around that I'm frequenting always. Cool pubs are down the street. It's directly across from the National Museum of Mexican Art, which is free. Free parking. 

Thanks for viewing. This place is perfect for college-aged or young professionals, but everyone with positive and safe energy is welcome, too. 

This neighborhood is considered an up and coming where some professionals and artists have settled. Some students also live here. It's hip with a raw feeling to it. I love it. Within 1 block there's an internet cafe, called NiteCap, and delicious authentic Mexican restaurants nearby.  Pubs are easy to walk to. I recommend Simone's, but Harbee's is closer. It's also next to a park and a Mexican Museum. There's a liquor store right next (West side) of the train station and a Family Dollar- which if you buy something there you can withdraw money and the ATM fees are only $1.50. So I go there to get laundry cash all of the time... and where I get my Junior Mints. Aldi, a supermarket, is nearby. 

•The Pink Line train station is less than 5 minutes walk to my place.
•The bus #18 on 18th St. is 1 minute away.    
•Bike rental is available next to the train station.

If you're able to send me an inquiry about certain dates then those dates are, indeed available and I'd love to host you. For everyone's safety I do request that guests upload a picture ID to AirBnB's website.    
 
Train and bus passes can be purchased at any train station and the attendants are very helpful if you have any questions. It's about $20 for a 3-day pass and $28 for a 7-day pass for both bus and the train.  And to rent bikes for 24 hours it's $7.

Four guests can stay here. Maybe 5 guests, but they must sleep on the couch.

The neighborhood is definitely safe. And awesome.

Take the train to downtown even if you've driven. It's a cool ride.

I ask for a security deposit because I have a TV and sound bar, mainly, I'd  like protected, just in case. I do not believe that it would be charged unless you gave your permission or Airbnb charges it, but please ask AirBnB any questions because I am unfamiliar with the details.","1) Check in is from 5-10PM. I can not greet guests before 5PM or after 10PM, so don’t even ask. If you arrive at 10:01PM, I will not be available to greet you under any circumstances because 10:01 is after 10PM. 
2) Check out is at 11:00AM.
3) Please read the itinerary that AirBnB will send you upon booking. The address and wifi information is on there. 
4) Read the signs as far as parking and yes, it's free and available. Don’t park on the South side of the street because that’s permit parking only. 
5) If you book the room for safety reasons I would prefer (meaning require) to greet you and hand you the keys, not your guests. 
6) I've found it best to communicate with guests only through the Airbnb message thread because it helps me remember guests' questions. So please talk to me through that Airbnb message thread only. 
7) If keys get lost I must charge $50 to replace them. 
8) Please wash, dry, and put away dirty dishes. If dishes are left out, I must charge a $20 fee. 
9) Before you check out please empty the garbages in each room and in the kitchen and take the garbage bag around to the back yard and place it in the larger garbage cans. Then place a clean garbage bag in the garbage can in the kitchen. Again, if this isn't done or if it's left in the back hallway then I must charge $20. 
10) Please tell me a day in advanced what time in between the hours of 5-10 you will be arriving. 
11) Be sure to have a current profile pic of yourselves that allows me to clearly see your face and not, say, you in a paintball mask or at age 10. 
12) If glitter is found in the house, you must pay $100, just cuz taking all that time to get glitter out of everywhere is redounkulous and I don’t have that time. 
13) Please be sure to upload a Gov ID to Airbnb’s website before sending a reservation request.

The back room is 8.5 feet by 7.5 ft.(2.60meters by 2.3 m), the front room is 9 ft. by 8 ft. (2.74m by 2.4m), and the bathroom is 7.5 ft. by 7.5 ft. (2.3m by 2.3m) including measuring the shower area. Each room has a closet, space heater, and towels. The kitchen has cook ware, dishes, and silverware. If you need something I don't have to cook with tell me and I'll go get it. The bathroom is on the smaller side. In an area in the hallway the floor is slightly damaged, but it's easy to avoid. Be sure to click on the picture to see the entire picture and then you’ll see it circled on the lower right hand corner of the pic. If you have 5 guests please keep in mind that the fifth person will have to sleep on the couch and the couch is not a hide a bed, couch. 

And you should know that before every guest arrives I clean thoroughly, including the bathroom. I use a drill brush (and sometimes a sponge) in the bathtub and bathtub tile, scrub around and on the toilet, sink, and windex the mirrors, and sweep the floor so it’s not going to get any cleaner. If there’s an off-white tinge to the bathtub area that’s a stain and not because it’s dirty. 

Parking is free. Be sure to read the signs to know if street cleaning will be arriving. They usually come from the month of November every 4th Monday between the hours of 7AM-9AM, or something like that. If you're driving and would prefer to drive to The Loop instead of paying for the train, then be sure to download the app, ""Parkwhiz"" or ""SpotHero.(URL HIDDEN)
I like to interact with guests. You will be given your own set of keys to the building and apartment and can come and go as you please.

 I want to preface the following by saying 95% of our guests leave our places in amazing condition. We are very understanding about small messes that may have been overlooked as I know I am by no means perfect. That being said the following is to address the 5% who may not understand quite how airbnb works yet.  

1. We are not a hotel.  
2. We are not your personal maids.   

While there is a cleaning fee, the fee is to cover changing of linens, washing of towels and ""normal"" cleaning of the kitchen, bathroom and living areas. What is not covered and WILL incur an extra fee are the following:   

1. A pile of dishes left in the sink (violates house rules)
2. Excessive kitchen messes such as cooking grease all over the stove. 
3. Excessive food on the floors (I dont mean a few crumbs-I mean it looked like someone was feeding pigeons). 
4. Chewing gum ground into the furniture (yes, that has actually happened). 
5. OBVIOUS wearing of shoes in the unit (we are a no-shoes house- see house rules) ie shoes foot prints, tracked in dirt and mud. 
 Anything else above and beyond what is considered ""normal"" cleaning.  
6. smoking in the unit will AUTOMATICALLY  incur a $200 fee.  
7. NO PETS. We have other units available that allow pets. please contact me about them. $100 fee if pets are found staying in the unit without prior consent.    

Again- this ISNT the majority of our guests and we understand things can be overlooked. Upon an ""excessive cleaning"" situation, I will not leave any review, I will simply send a request for an extra cleaning fee (usually around $25-50) depending on how much extra time it took to clean.

Thanks for viewing. This place is perfect for college-aged or young professionals, but everyone is welcome, including LGBT peeps, people with disabilities, all immigrants from any and every country, all women, minorities, international travelers, marchers, and everyone else. Positive, safe, and fun energy is welcome here.

I like to interact with guests. You will be given your own set of keys to the building and apartment and can come and go as you please. 

This neighborhood is considered an up and coming area for artists and is very cool. Within 1 block there's an internet cafe, called NiteCap, and delicious authentic Mexican restauraunts, Los Camales and El Mesquite.  Pubs are easy to walk to. I recommend Simone's but Harbee's is closer. It's also next to a park and a Mexican Museum. There's a liquor store right next (West side) of the train station and a Family Dollar- which if you buy something there you can withdraw money and the ATM fees are only $1.50. So I go there to get laundry cash all of the time... and where I get my Junior Mints.:)  

The Pink Line train station is less than 5 minutes walk to my place.
The bus #18 on 18th St. is 1 minute away.    
Bike rental is available next to the train station.

If you're able to send me an inquiry about certain dates then those dates are, indeed, available and I'd love to host you. For everyone's safety I do request that guests upload a picture ID to AirBnB's website.    
 
Train and bus passes can be purchased at any train station and the attendants are very helpful if you have any questions. It's $20 for a 3-day pass and $28 for a 7-day pass for both bus and the train.  And to rent bikes for 24 hours it's $7.

The vibe of The Flower Power room is that it's similar to a hostel, but with private rooms. It's a 2-bedroom apartment and the other room, The Sugar Skull Room, https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6957460, also has AirBnB guests. You will have the opportunity to meet other travelers if you want or have as much privacy as you’d like. 

I find that guests who enjoy staying here are those that truly enjoy interacting with other guests. So don't be afraid to chat with your flat mate, share a story, grab a meal together, or explore the wonderful city together, if you're inclined. 

To insure safety I require guests to upload their drivers license or passport to AirBnB's website.  Often, guests enjoy each other's company and sometimes attend the same events, so it enhances their Chicago experience. And, of course, you'll have your key to the bedroom, too, so, again, no privacy will be given up.

It's safe.

Train and bus passes can be purchased at any train station and the attendants are very helpful if you have any questions. It's $20 for a 3-day pass and $28 for a 7-day pass for both bus and the train.

While check in is from 4-10, I do offer the option to guests to check in early or late, check-out late, and luggage storage if I'm available for a flat $20 fee. Under no circumstances can I show guests to a dirty room. When asking to check in early or late please give me at least a day in advanced so preparing your room will be the first of things to do on my list.","1) Check in is from 4-10PM. 
2) Check out is at 11:00AM.
3) Please read the itinerary that AirBnB will send you upon booking.
4) Read the signs as far as parking and yes, it's free and available. 
5) And if you book the room for safety reasons I would prefer to greet you and hand you the keys, not your guests. 
6) I've found it best to communicate with guests only through the Airbnb thread because it helps me remember guests' questions. So please talk to me through that Airbnb message thread only. 
7) If keys get lost I must charge $50 to replace them.
8) The apps on the fire stick are offered but I do not offer my personal username and password for the apps, so you’ll have to have your own. 
9) While check in is from 4-10 a greeting time or an estimated greeted time must be told to me a day in advanced so that I can plan my day accordingly if you book a reservation before the day of your arrival. If you do send me an estimated time of arrival then please specify that your arrival time is an estimate and then I could agree to also meet you at that estimated time. 

Thanks for your inquiry and interest. I work hard to accommodate guests and be sure that the rooms are very clean.

Southport Corridor (a semi-official part of the larger Lakeview area) is fast-becoming one of Chicago's premiere neighborhoods, offering a variety of dining, shopping, and lifestyle options along a one-mile stretch between Belmont and Irving Park. Situated alongside Wrigley Field to the southwest, Southport Avenue is a mix of popular chains (JCrew, Gap, Anthropologie, Lululemon) as well as independently-owned specialty shops and boutiques. The area is very pedestrian-friendly, with businesses catering to the needs of neighborhood families, young professionals, and dog owners. Adjacent to Southport Corridor, and a ten minute walk to the northeast, Wrigleyville has recently undergone extensive renovations and new construction that blend the traditional ballpark with modern amenities which serve to enhance the game day experience.

This location, at Belmont and Southport avenues, is ideal for enjoying the neighborhood. Shopping, dining, and entertainment are within walking distance to the north and northeast. Multiple transportation options enable you to visit all parts of the city and return home at the end of the day for a comfortable night's rest.

"Please READ ALL THE RULES before booking, this helps to ensure both a happy guest and host!! Happy people are awesome!! 
--If you need an odd hour early check-in, late check-out or luggage storage, I am flexible with times but let's discuss before completing reservation and there will be a $25 dollar charge to your reservation for EARLY check -in, this includes luggage storage. Your room may still be in use by previous guest and I need time to make it clean and ready for you so early check-in is not always available! IF YOU CHECK OUT LATE AND ITS NOT PRE ARRANGED at least 24 hrs before check-out, YOU WILL BE CHARGED $25 every 15 minutes past CHECK OUT TIME, this charge starts 1 minute after the check out time and this is not a joke, holding up cleaning the room for another guest or for whatever reason I desire, is quite rude and I expect that you leave at the scheduled time. This includes luggage storage which is $25 charge. Dear Instant book guest and SAME DAY BOOKERS, if you make your reservation after MIDNIGHT, most likely I am asleep and will not respond till normal waking hours. Please be patient for reply and understand that access to enter the home is not immediate.

-Your Clock Alarm can be heard through the whole house, please turn it off once it goes off the first time. Hitting snooze and allowing your alarm to repeatedly go off is very disturbing and rude, other people live here and may not have the same schedule. 
-Please be mindful of loud cell phone use in common areas, if you are in a common area such as kitchen or front room, and must answer your phone, you must ALSO leave the area and complete your conversation in your room. No one else here wants to hear your conversation!! It is very rude to have a phone conversation while someone else in the room is preparing their food, eating at the table or simply just wants to chill in the same room.  In particular I ask for Absolutely NO talking on phone in bathroom and NO SPEAKER PHONE conversations in the home. Speaker phone conversation are extremely loud and can be heard through the entire home.

-Black garbage can is for recycle trash. Metal garbage is for regular trash.
-There is a fee for laundry services, using washer and laundry is two dollars fee per load. please leave the cash in the tin box that is labeled to the right of the washer.

There is Vittum Chicago public park  2 blocks away with a tennis court, basketball court , children's playground and skating ramp. This is a residential location with ample free parking, perfect if you rent a car. We are down the street from Our Lady of Snows Elementary school and church. I have very active and friendly neighbors, please feel free to say hello and let the neighbor  know that you are a guest of mine should they seemed alarmed about a new face on the block. There are a few local owned bars and fast food places walking distance, but nothing fancy, a little travel is recommended for something more memorable. Polish deli & Puerto Rican cafe are some favorites by guests so far. Walking distance to several CTA bus lines that will take you CTA train. Safe to walk at night, but some buses do not run late evenings near my home. A Ride share service such as Uber or Lyft can get you home from the nearest CTA train station for about Ten dollars. Can also prearrange a ride from me for a cost. Racetrack in Cicero is less than two miles away. Entrance/Exit to Stevenson expressway less than two miles away.

The room is up a flight of stairs on 2nd floor.  The 2nd door to the left when you come up the 2nd floor hallway. The room is one of three bedrooms on the floor. So please keep it quiet after 10pm. There is a key to the bedroom, so feel free to lock up your room when you leave. You will have privacy but minimal sound barrier, meaning that noise travels easily through the walls and shut doors.  This maybe an issue if you are a light sleeper or extremely value a sound barrier. There maybe two or three people living in the home at the time of your stay. Weekdays, we get up around 630am and will be busy in the kitchen making some noise with breakfast and getting ready to head out for the day, the home will be silent after 730am when we leave for the day. I promise the noise in kitchen will only last a few minutes. Due to an elementary school being a few doors down, the children playing recess outside can be heard during the day. Other than that, its a pretty quiet home.  
The metal garbage can is for regular trash.
The black garbage can is for recycled trash. 
Everyone in the home is conscious of environmental issues and healthy diets, we recycle what we can, and eat the best that we can but as some would speculate, we are not  all vegetarians please note that there might be meat and non recycle items in the home.

Not often in person but constantly vie text & mobile
You can call or text me pretty much any time if you have any questions or need anything at all. 
I work from home, and I live in the unit.  You will have access to the living and dining area, and both full and half bathrooms, along with the kitchen, but not to the fourth bedroom/office at the very back of the building, where I will work on weekdays, and where I may sleep. I'm often gone in evenings overnight. I won't get in your way, and am rarely around when guests stay, but close by if you need me. 
I am happy to act as a host and provide tips on where to go and what to see, or to just leave you on your own.

It's green and shaded. Located down the street from a 2.5 acre park—Mayfair. And it's really quiet with friendly neighbors. Beautiful tree lined streets with lots of kids and people walking their pets. 
Many of our neighbors have lived here for over 30 years and now their children are moving back. You will see bungalows being remodeled with a second story addition, and tear-downs getting replaced with big houses. Within a few blocks there are an amazing and diverse number of churches, temples and mosques. Plenty of groceries, pharmacies, restaurants and entertainment half a mile or so away, but this is more of a residential neighborhood, not the kinetic pace of the urban/mixed use neighborhoods closer in.
Four blocks from Mayfair Park.  Nearby are Independence Park (accessible on the Blue Line at Irving Park) and Portage Park (2 miles west and south from here and also on Irving Park Boulevard),  both of which run great farmer's markets on several Sundays through October.

There is a great sports bar two blocks away and several pubs and a well known Karaoke place. 
And three blocks away is a famous burger stand and soft serve joint (Susie's) that's open 24 hours! 
Great Middle Eastern restaurant a few blocks away. And I order pizza all the time from Saparinos. 
We have a guide to our favorites in the ""book"" box on the coffee table.
If you really want to experience the ""foodie"" part of Chicago, it's a short drive or L train to Logan Square, or Armitage & Western or to North Ave & Damen, where you can find several hundred restaurants and bars. Then come home to peace and quiet in my hood.

The area has become a prevailing influence on Chicago's Michelin-rated, James Beard Award-winning dining scene, boasting some of the city's most sought after tables. Wicker Park is known for palate pleasing nightcaps, like renowned brewery Piece and mixology tour de force The Violet Hour.

Along North, Division, Milwaukee and Damen Avenues (""the six corners""), you will find an unbelievable blend of vintage shops amid independently-owned boutiques touting fashions for both men and women, and luxury home goods and beauty products. On the same blocks are nationally-recognized names in fashion, and a mix of major retail chains that have also set up shop to satisfy the on-trend crowds.

Parking in Chicago is often difficult and even more so in the evening and during special events. We recommend using a service called SpotHero because it allows you to reserve a nearby paid parking spot in advance so that you don’t have to worry about finding parking when you arrive.

3. When is check-in/check-out?

Check-in is 3 p.m. or later but you're welcome to stop by anytime after 11:30 a.m. to drop off your bags in the living room.

Check-out is at 11 a.m. Our cleaning staff will need access to the apartment at 11 a.m., but you’re welcome to leave your bags in the living room and pick them up by 2:30 p.m. at the latest.

4. “Can a third person stay in the room with me?”

We allow a maximum of two guests per room. We have additional rooms available if you need accommodations for more than two people. Send us a message for more info.

5. Will I have my own private bathroom?

The bathroom is shared with the other bedrooms.","THIS TROVE HAS

✔ 50"" HDTV w/ Netflix (no cable TV)

Chelsea and Jason

We're located in Andersonville, a traditionally Swedish neighborhood that is full of antique shops, coffee houses, boutiques, an independent bookstore, and many restaurants. (Really, we have everything - Italian, Irish, Swedish, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Mexican, Japanese, lots of spots to grab a cocktail... you get the idea.)

Our apartment is located a five-minute walk from near the top of Andersonville. The building has retained a lot of the old Chicago character, with a big bay window in the living room and a brick fireplace (non-working). While we are very close to the heart of Andersonville, being just two blocks away and on the third floor means it's generally very quiet and peaceful. In the early morning, sunlight floods the living and dining rooms, and in spring, we generally wake up to birdsong. Essentially, it's gorgeous and green in summer, yellow and orange in fall, and when it snows in the winter, the snow sitting on the tree branches is gorgeous.

Please note that Jason and I do have a dog. She's super sweet, eight-years-old, and absolutely loves having visitors. She's not very big (about 35 lbs.), doesn't bark, and doesn't jump. Please note that she does shed (we clean frequently though, not to worry!), so if you have allergies this probably isn't the place for you. We will provide you with a lint roller during your stay.

You are welcome to any part of the apartment except our bedroom. Feel free to cook, work at my desk or the dining table, or watch a movie on the couch. Just please note I do work from home, so if you are here on a weekday, I will need general quiet from 9-5.

Andersonville is an historically Swedish neighborhood full of restaurants. In our neighborhood (mainly on Clark Street) you will find:

- One of the best burgers in Chicago at Little Bad Wolf
- Amazing sushi at Tanoshii (Also try their udon noodle soup!)
- One of the best Italian dinners of your life at Anteprima
- Coffee at Coffee Studio, La Colombe, Colective, or Kopi
- Fantastic brunch at M. Henry or The Bongo Room
- A summertime patio perfect for a drink at HopLeaf
- Truly phenomenal pie at First Slice Cafe

Wonderful shops you'll find include a lot of antique stores and furniture stores. Also included on the strip is the Swedish American Museum and Women and Children First bookstore.

If you venture through the beautiful residential neighborhood to the train (Bryn Mawr stop), you'll have even more fantastic food options. Our favorites are:
- Ben's Noodles and Rice for the most amazing pineapple fried rice for $10
- The best croissants in Chicago at Phlour
- Amazing and comforting Pho Ga (for those who are unfamiliar, it's essentially Vietnamese chicken noodle soup) at Little Vietnam

- There is free parking on and around my block. Parking is very easy; we have rarely needed to park as far as the opposite end of the block.
- You can catch the 22 bus east two blocks from our apartment to downtown and Wrigley Field. Note that you must either have a transit card or cash to board. Bus rides are $2.25 cash and they do not give change.

- The 24-hour Red Line train is a lovely .8 mile walk and will take you directly downtown. Train tickets are $3 for a single ride.  

(Insider's note- If you buy a card, it's only $0.25 to transfer from one mode of transportation to the other if you transfer within 2 hours of your original boarding time. But if you plan on riding a lot while you're here, just get a 3-day pass.)

For the amenities please note:

- To keep down on clutter, the straightener, hair dryer, and ironing board are put away. If you need them, please let us know and we are happy to get them for you. 

- Shower soap, shampoo, and conditioner are located in the shower.

- Our coffee machine is a French press (we also have a kettle). Please note we do not provide coffee.","- PLEASE NOTE: If you book with us from April 2 - May 20, only Jason will be home to host you.
- Basic cleanliness
- Relative quiet in the afternoons (I work from home) and after 10pm
- No additional guests. Guests who bring additional people back to the apartment without the knowledge and permission of the hosts is subject to a $30 surcharge.
- Please do not book if you yourself are not one of the guests. No booking on behalf of others.",,"Andersonville is an historically Swedish neighborhood full of restaurants. In our neighborhood (mainly on Clark Street) you will find:

As much privacy as you desire will be respected and provided.

Very safe residential area, we are in Chicago but have a suburb feel.  Quiet, clean, working- middle class family oriented neighborhood near public skate park, midway airport, CTA, race track and free abundant parking! You will feel comfortable walking home alone during late nights if need be.  Garfield Ridge/ Vittum park neighborhood located 10 miles from downtown. Just 2 miles from Chicago Midway Airport and 1 mile from I -55/ Stevenson expressway. There is Vittum Chicago public park  2 blocks away with a tennis court, basketball court , children's playground and skating ramp. This is a residential location with ample free parking, perfect if you rent a car. We are down the street from Our Lady of Snows Elementary school and church. I have very active and friendly neighbors, please feel free to say hello and let the neighbor  know that you are a guest of mine should they seemed alarmed about a new face on the block. There are a few locally owned bars and fast food places walking distance, but nothing fancy, a little travel is recommended for something more memorable. Polish deli & Puerto Rican cafe are some local favorites by guests so far. Walking distance to several CTA bus lines that will take you CTA train. Again, safe to walk at night, but some buses do not run late evenings near my home or weather might get be uncomfortable for walking, if that's the case just about ten bucks to use ride sharing service from nearest train line. Can prearrange a ride with me for a cost, if I am available. Racetrack in Cicero and Stevenson expressway less than two miles away.

There are four bus routes just a 10 min walk / half a mile away.
#62 bus- Travels East,
 takes you straight into Chinatown and  Downtown, stops at Orange line on the way
#62H bus -travels East and West takes you to midway airport/ Orange line
#47 st bus- travels mostly directly east, all the way to Lakefront , stops at red line on way, short trip West to Orange line/Midway airport at some non peak hours 
#54B Cicero Bus- Travels North and South, takes you to pink line and Orange LINE
The nearest Metra stop is the BNSF Railway in Cicero, Il. Just about 3 miles away.

Although we are avid music lovers, this is a quiet , low volume home due to our busy days, we highly value coming home to a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere, perfect if you want to study or get some work done, guest are encouraged to keep entertainment noise contained to their perspective room, with volume low or use headphones, in particular during the weekdays! The room is down a flight of stairs and separated from the rest of the house by a curtain.  There is no door, only this curtain. Additional privacy can be added by a room divider that is set up for you at the foot of staircase/ entrance to the room. You will have privacy but no sound barrier, meaning if we are on the main floor/ kitchen you will hear us and we will hear you. This might be an issue if you are a light sleeper or extremely value a sound barrier. There maybe two or three people living in the home at the time of your stay. Weekdays, we get up around 630am and will be busy in the kitchen making some noise with breakfast and getting ready to head out for the day, the home will be silent after 730-8am when we leave for the day. I promise the early morning noise in kitchen will only last a few minutes, but if you want a place to sleep in, please consider another location as it is hard for me to control normal daytime noise from other airbnb guest in the home who need to use the kitchen as well. Due to an elementary school being a few doors down, the children playing recess outside can be heard during the day. Other than that, its a pretty quiet home.  
Everyone in the home is conscious of environmental issues and healthy diets, but as some would speculate, we are not all vegetarians please note that there might be meat and non recycle items in the home.  We are part of the local punk DIY community. Waldorf School parent and  Loyola University of Chicago parent resides in the home. Musician and artist reside in the home. LGBTQ friendly. Babysitting, pet sitting, car rides, and laundry service might be available for separate fee, please ask if interested.

Please note that a Pet fee will be added if you choose to bring your furry friend .This room cannot accommodate cats. Dogs only. Cats will be considered on a case by case basis, for my other listing:  Lush Bed Lavender Room. 
-Laundry for your pets needs to be done at outside laundry mat. My washer and dryer cannot handle pet hair/dander. 
-When booking the room please include pet in the number of guest for correct reservation and will discuss pricing for pet fee before booking.  
-The home is not child proof, please keep a mindful eye on your child and do not let them wander into unattended rooms of the home. We cannot accommodate your child if they cannot sleep through the night,  have bed wetting issues or behavioral problems. I am a parent myself and do apologies for the rules with children and pets but I need to keep the home suitable with low maintenance for future guest.
-If you break or damage something, please notify me immediately, I do understand accidents happen, but it is extremely offensive to withhold this information from your host
-Remember this is my home, and NOT a hotel
-Break the rules, you risk the reservation being canceled. Which means you will be required to leave. Due to the listing's strict cancellation policy, this also means you will not be refunded if your reservation gets canceled early due to non- compliance with house rules.","We work and go to school during the weekdays. More flexible with our time on the weekends. Up for a chat, give suggestions for your trip and be available for you, should you have questions but depending on the time and days you will be here, we might hardly see each other.  As much privacy as you desire will be respected and provided.
PREFERRED MODE OF CONTACT IS AIRBNB MESSENGER SYSTEM. Text and phone calls are acceptable but please try and use the Airbnb messenger system as main mode of communication.","Very safe residential area, we are in Chicago but have a suburb feel.  Quiet, clean, working- middle class family oriented neighborhood near public skate park, midway airport, CTA, race track and free abundant parking! You will feel comfortable walking home alone during late nights if need be.  Garfield Ridge/ Vittum park neighborhood located 10 miles from downtown. Just 2 miles from Chicago Midway Airport and 1 mile from I -55/ Stevenson expressway. There is Vittum Chicago public park  2 blocks away with a tennis court, basketball court , children's playground and skating ramp. This is a residential location with ample free parking, perfect if you rent a car. We are down the street from Our Lady of Snows Elementary school and church. I have very active and friendly neighbors, please feel free to say hello and let the neighbor  know that you are a guest of mine should they seemed alarmed about a new face on the block. There are a few locally owned bars and fast food places walking distance, but nothing fancy, a little travel is recommended for something more memorable. Polish deli & Puerto Rican cafe are some local favorites by guests so far. Walking distance to several CTA bus lines that will take you CTA train. Again, safe to walk at night, but some buses do not run late evenings near my home or weather might get be uncomfortable for walking, if that's the case just about ten bucks to use ride sharing service from nearest train line. Can prearrange a ride with me for a cost, if I am available. Racetrack in Cicero and Stevenson expressway less than two miles away.","Although we are avid music lovers, this is a quiet , low volume home due to our busy days, we highly value coming home to a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere, perfect if you want to study or get some work done, guest are encouraged to keep entertainment noise contained to their perspective room, with volume low or use headphones, in particular during the weekdays! The room is down a flight of stairs and separated from the rest of the house by a curtain.  There is no door, only this curtain. Additional privacy can be added by a room divider that is set up for you at the foot of staircase/ entrance to the room. You will have privacy but no sound barrier, meaning if we are on the main floor/ kitchen you will hear us and we will hear you. This might be an issue if you are a light sleeper or extremely value a sound barrier. There maybe two or three people living in the home at the time of your stay. Weekdays, we get up around 630am and will be busy in the kitchen making some noise with breakfast and getting ready to head out for the day, the home will be silent after 730-8am when we leave for the day. I promise the early morning noise in kitchen will only last a few minutes, but if you want a place to sleep in, please consider another location as it is hard for me to control normal daytime noise from other airbnb guest in the home who need to use the kitchen as well. Due to an elementary school being a few doors down, the children playing recess outside can be heard during the day. Other than that, its a pretty quiet home.  
Everyone in the home is conscious of environmental issues and healthy diets, but as some would speculate, we are not all vegetarians please note that there might be meat and non recycle items in the home.  We are part of the local punk DIY community. Waldorf School parent and  Loyola University of Chicago parent resides in the home. Musician and artist reside in the home. LGBTQ friendly. Babysitting, pet sitting, car rides, and laundry service might be available for separate fee, please ask if interested. 
Please include children in the number of guest when booking!!
Please include pet as a second guest, although this listing, will not automatically charge you for the second guest, there will be a pet fee added if you decide room here with your pet.  There Will BE A PET FEE!
There is a washer and dryer in the home, please make arrangements with me before using them on your own. There is a limit to washer & dryer use!
The metal garbage can is for regular trash
The black garbage can is for recycled trash
If you need additional heat, there will be extra blankets (check the closet next to the bathroom or laundry room) for you to keep warm but please feel free to turn on the wall heater,  move the furniture away from the wall heater before you turn it ON and remember to to turn off the it OFF when you leave the room for an extending period of time. Please speak to me before turning on wall heater!!!
This my home, not a hotel please remember that:-)

***** NOTES *****
(1) REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY (see below)
(2) The host typically would like to greet the guests in person, occasionally this may not be possible.  In the latter case, please contact the host for the procedure of ""Self Check-in"".~~  Do not wait in front of the house or the porch of the house (stay in your car if you drive) while you are talking with or waiting for the host. Not all neighbors like the concept of Airbnb, and  sometimes people can exaggerate a little thing into a big matter.  We want to stay low key and not disturb our neighbors.  ~~
(3) Each room has its own numeric lock (no charge) and the guest can set his/her own code. The lock is very secure. If you forget the code, the lock must be cut and destroyed.  The cost  for each lock is $11 when it must be destroyed.  Please leave the host your code and do not try to reset the lock (as you are likely to make a mistake and render the lock useless).
(4) Typically we can arrange 24-hour FREE street parking (just in the front or near the front of the house) for up to 33 days of stays.  It is the Guests' responsibility to do a simple registration with the village for street parking (Please ask the host for details). Street parking is pretty safe in this area as it is safe to begin with and the village polices are very  diligent in patrolling.  However if you still want a garage parking for some reasons, the cost is $6 per day and its availability is on the first come first serve basis.  The payment for Garage Parking (free for street parking) needs to be made right after your booking for securing the garage space. If you stay in the house for more than one month, please discuss the parking matter with the host as part of your booking process.

REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY
Guests choose a place to stay based what it serves them the best.  We would like to highlight a few items worth considering and invite you to book this place.
(a) We run a very efficient operation and have a very competitive room rate with high quality rooms and services;
(b) This house is located in an exceptional great locale.  It is about 8 minutes to Blue Line Austin Station by walking (hence very close to downtown Chicago) and has convenient access to west, north west, and south west of greater Chicagoland by car. Via CTA Blue Line, you can arrive Chicago O'Hare Airport as its last station.
(c) Free parking up to a month can be easily arranged.  Parking can be very very expensive in any larger metropolitan, including downtown Chicago.  Therefore it is much more economical to park here and take the train to downtown Chicago. If you rent a room in or near downtown Chicago, you implicitly or explicitly spend a lot of money just on parking.
(d) The ""Occupancy Tax"" is about 11% in this village which is much less than 23% or higher (doubled) in Chicago. The occupancy tax is paid by the guests based on the sum of room rate and cleaning fee.  With this tax and parking cost in mind, it is much more economical (and still without losing convenient access to downtown Chicago) to stay in a convenient suburbs rather than in Chicago or downtown Chicago. Since the ""Occupancy Tax"" is waived if you stay 31 days or longer, you can avoid this tax and save quite a bit of money if you plan your trip ahead and check with the host for room availability.

This home has three levels, all connected with an open and dramatic sense of space.  Main floor features entryway, living room and kitchen with seating for six at the enormous island, a powder room, and a view to the two-story family room.  

Lower level has the two-story family room with walkout backyard and patio.  Lower level also has a dining table, a media room (there's an office setup in the media room) and a full bath.

Upper floor has the master suite with private deck and master bath, laundry, and a second full bath shared by two additional bedrooms.  Each of the three bedrooms has a queen bed -- there is nowhere else to sleep.  Therefore, a maximum of six people, depending on your sleeping configuration.

Note:  There are open risers on the main stairwell, and on the front entry stairs -- you are responsible for your own safety in the entire house including the stairs, and for the safety of your children and pets.

High-speed wireless internet, home theater, three 65 inch smart TVs, everything to relax or take care of business including a printer and scanner.

Easy walking distance to public transportation and the best that Chicago has to offer.

Our car will take up the other half of the two-car garage.  The street is not zoned, and parking is usually abundant, so you may prefer to park on the street.","- Security Deposit.

This is a colorful diverse neighborhood located in the city's southwest side.

There's free street parking, either in front of building or the streets close to building. The orange line train is near by. I recommend Uber or Lyft because will be more convenient and faster.

21% Discount for 7+ days.  Available all last week of March.

My place is still coming together, as I only make purchases that I'm in love with, and am letting it grow into itself.  The photos are mostly up to date although the second room desk has been swapped out for something more minimal.

I am pretty confident that anyone fond of modern design will enjoy it.  It has a decent sound system and plenty of space to relax in.  When I bought this space, it was the only one I actually saw in person.  Most Chicago condos have somewhat small living rooms, but mine is substantially bigger.  I knew it's what I wanted and went for it.

If you're reserving my entire apartment, I will not be around in person, but I am usually just a quick text away.

I am a quick walk away from Wicker Park, right about where Milwaukee starts to get interesting.  There is enough to do in that neighborhood to keep you busy for several days.  The Loop and Logan Square are quick train rides away, and Old Town, Lincoln Park, and Lakeview are quite easy to get to by bus or Uber.

I am 1000 feet from the Division Blue Line. It offers super easy access to and from O'Hare, as well as The Loop.

My girlfriend and I are now the proud parents of a pug.  He's quite a dandy guy.  We sweep and vacuum all the time, but that's not to mean it will be hair free.   Please keep this in mind when booking.",- No shoes in the house preferred.,"If you're reserving my entire apartment, I will not be around in person, but I am usually just a quick text away.","I am a quick walk away from Wicker Park, right about where Milwaukee starts to get interesting.

The Lakeview neighborhood and Wrigleyville / Boystown areas have so much within walking distance, you won't want to leave!

PARKING
Free, public street parking is available in the area. Some streets require a permit, and others do not. We offer permits at the unit for a small fee.

Old Town is a little more than a mile north of downtown Chicago.  This historic neighborhood is unlike any other in Chicago with its many tiny streets, Victorian-era buildings, shops, and hidden gardens. Originally a collection of farm fields just west of Lake Michigan, Old Town has had many incarnations through the years including being a so-called ‘hippie haven’ in the 1960s with trendy boutiques, restaurants and folk music venues like the Earl of Old Town and the Old Town School of Folk Music.  Of course, Old Town is also home to The Second City, the world famous improv comedy theater, which also opened back in those counter-culture days. Tree-lined Wells Street features old-school pubs, charming eateries and artisanal coffee shops, as well as quirky boutiques.

Hip Wicker Park has been a residential enclave since Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837. North Milwaukee Avenue is known for its bustling nightlife, dining and entertainment venues, with Subterranean and Davenport’s setting the bar for the city's trendy music clubs. North Damen Avenue draws hip crowds with its quirky shops, minimalist cafes, specialty grocery stores and cool fashion boutiques.
The Bloomingdale Line was a 2.7-mile (4.3 km) elevated railroad running east-west on the northwest side of Chicago. In 2015, the City of Chicago converted it into an elevated greenway called The Bloomingdale Trail, which forms the backbone of the linear park and trail network called The 606.

Two blue line stops within walking distance. It is a direct line to the O’Hare airport and downtown. You get one parking space with your reservation. If you have additional cars, there is Spothero parking nearby and I can text you a coupon for it.

IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON HAVING A CELEBRATION: Unregistered guests are not allowed on the property.  Presence of more than 14 guests is unlawful. A guest is anyone at the property, staying the night or just visiting. There is a counter installed and police will be notified immediately. This is not a place for a local house party. 

CONSIDER PURCHASING MY WORRY FREE CLEANING PACKAGE: For those of you traveling to Chicago to celebrate together: for additional $100 you do not have to clean anything.

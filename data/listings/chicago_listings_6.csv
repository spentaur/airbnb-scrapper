https://airbnb.com/h/penthouse804

To access the building, we give you a simple code to go in-and-out as you please. You walk up the stairs to the elevators, and take the elevator to the top floor, the 8th floor.

When you exit the elevator, you turn right and then left down the hallway to your homes. 
When you enter each home, they open to an open, spacious loft. There is a dining area, a kitchen, a living room, a half bathroom,and private patio for those staying on the first level. 

There are 3 private patios for your access.

If you walk up to the 2nd floor, you will find a spacious loft with two full size beds, a huge closet,  and a full bathroom. This is truly a special place, and we look forward to making your stay a 5-star experience!

Q: Is the neighborhood safe?
A: Very much so. 24 hours a day.

Q: PARKING?
A: The home is very easy to get to via public transit. If you decide to drive, we recommend apps like SpotAngel or SpotHero to find free or cheap parking ($10-20 / night). 

Q: Do I need to bring towels, a hair dryer, or linens?
A: Nope! we provide all these things. Same with hotel-size toiletries (unless I happen to be out, which is rare).

Q: When can I check in or check out? 
A: Check in is 4pm and check out is 10am. Early check ins can be difficult if there are guests who checked out same day. We ask for an early check-in, or a late-check out fee, if you request either.

Q: Can I come and go as I please?
A: Yes. And we wouldn't trust any listing with which this isn't the case.

Q: Is the place professionally cleaned between guests?
A: Yes, and we take pride in providing a clean home for guests.

Q: What's my total booking price? 
A: We honestly have no idea. With fees included, it only shows the guest how much they pay. This figure should be present after you enter your dates. Note that, pricing varies on a daily basis, and it actually uses some crazy algorithm to adjust it automatically, so I don't actually control this.

Q: Are the beds comfortable?
A: Very. Some guests say they're the best they've ever slept on!

Q: Is this all one unit? 
A: No. Just to be clear these are four separate units that are all right next to each other in an exclusive area on the top floor.

You have access to all 4 suites, the gym, the patios, and the laundry in the lower level.

We're here to help as you need it! We give all of our guests full itinerary for their trip 2 days before their stay.

Printers Row is ‚Äúpocket‚Äù neighborhood  just minutes from the Chicago Loop. After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the area became the Midwest hub of the printing industry with historically significant buildings designed by legendary architects like Daniel Burnham, William Holabird and William Le Baron Jenney. Today, many of those historic buildings remain but the quiet, tree lined streets are now largely residential. Of course, it continues to be a draw for fans of Chicago architecture.

During the day, the neighborhood is an easy walk to offices in the Loop, off Michigan Avenue, or in LaSalle Street financial centers. After hours, the district is alive with restaurants, boutiques, book and antique stores.

It boasts famous blues clubs, eclectic music venues and neighborhood taverns where residents gather. It also has an annual book fair: The Printers Row Book Fair gathers authors, poets, speakers and, of course, books.

Printer's Row is also walking distance to Chicago's Museum Campus, with the Field Museum, Adler Planetarium and Shedd Aquarium, and the newly redesigned Soldier Field.

With a 97 walk score and 100 transit score, you can get everywhere your heart desires in Chicago. The Red Line subway is one of the main subways in Chicago, and is only a block away. Many restaurants, shopping, parks, and museums are within walking distance.

Humboldt Park is an emerging Chicago neighborhood on the near west side.  It's close enough to Wicker Park, Bucktown, and Logan Square that you can easily get to these neighborhoods by bus or lyft/uber but far enough away that it's quiet when you want it to be.  

The park is BEAUTIFUL and offers swimming, fishing, tennis, baseball, and soccer. 

We are also a 5-minute walk to the 606 bike/walk path that enters on either Drake or Lawndale.  This bike path will take you to the Wicker Park, south Logan Square, and Bucktown neighborhoods.

We are right by the North Ave  (72) bus that will take you to the Blue L line in 15 minutes and the Red L line in a half hour. Also a short distance from the Chicago (66) bus that will take you to the Red L line.  Lyft/Uber are your best bets in our neighborhood because we are a little ways from city action.

My husband, Dave, is a local Chicago chef and is available for a private tasting menu at our house if you'd like to book that with your stay (not included in Airbnb fees).","Smoking outside, please.

There are often guests socializing with other guests or the staff in the communal areas on the first floor. Many guests enjoy using the living or dining rooms as a pseudo-cafe where they can drink coffee or tea and work on their laptops. We encourage our guests to interact and use the shared spaces as they would their own homes. However, no one will shame you for hanging out in your room. We want everyone to feel safe and comfortable.

The Greenleaf House has become a hub in the Glenwood Avenue Art District of Roger‚Äôs Park, where all flavors of creative artists have lived and collaborated for several decades. The Mile of Murals‚Äîa community-based public art initiative‚Äîbegins half a block from our front door. Within easy walking distance you will find a bustling nightlife, small theaters and music venues, several locally-owned eateries, and Loyola Park, which has a great playground and arguably the best sand beach in the city.

Here are a few links about our neighborhood:

The Greenleaf House is conveniently located near two major public trains‚Äîwe are one block from the El (CTA Red Line at Morse Avenue) and three blocks (5-8 minute walk) from the Roger‚Äôs Park Metra Station. There are several bus stops within walking distance, including express buses to downtown. It is also never difficult to hail a cab, and Uber/Lyft rides generally arrive in 1-5 minutes after placing a request. For your convenience, we have included links to public transit information below.

Make no mistake, East Garfield Park is definitely the inner city.  It's filled with beauty and grit! There is a ton of diversity, art and life.  Think SoHo in the 70's.  You can't walk to a coffee shop but you can catch an art opening, eat some real BB-Q, walk the park and actually say hello to a total stranger.  Not a common thing for a big city.

Isn't that one of the best parts of travel!?

5 minute walk to the Kedzie Green Line takes you downtown in 9 minutes.  We're about 35 minutes from either airport.

I'm working during the day on weekdays, and occasionally on weekends, but I'm usually around in the evenings.  I'm happy to answer any and all questions, give directions and suggestions of what to do in the city!

My 2 dogs are also very friendly and welcoming-a little scratch behind the ears and they're your new best friend:)

The Rogers Park area has been experiencing a lot of growth-from new housing to restaurants and shopping.  There are also a number of ""hole in the wall"" gems that have been in the area for a long time.  There's a little bit of everything in this area.

Also, if you're staying for an extended time, there is a grocery store within a few minutes walking distance, along with both a Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts on the way to the el station.

The beauty of living in the city is that it's so easy to get around with public transportation!  There is easy access to buses, the ""el"" subway system, metra, and there are also cabs readily available.  

Transportation to/from the airport and condo: Both airports have an el line stop inside the airport, and can be taken to within a couple blocks of the condo (Howard stop).  There is also a cab line at each airport.  They're more direct and faster, but also more expensive than the el.

This 2nd story, apartment features an eat in kitchen, a double and a single bedroom, and a front room that oozes Chicago history.

Perfect for a quick weekend getaway or an extended stay. A Walk Score of 97 means you won't need a car to experience the city. Easy access to Division Blue Line, nightlife, shopping & adventure.

Take a step back in time and into a curious home full of art, light and vintage Chicago in this classic workman's Victorian cottage. 

Enter through the landscaped courtyard at the back of the building and up the outdoor staircase. 

The eat in kitchen comes equipped with everything we think you'll need including a microwave, antique farmhouse sink, apartment sized stove, full size fridge, and cooking utensils. 

Separated from the kitchen by curtains  is the master bedroom. You'll get a great night's sleep with  a queen size bed with a Sterns and Foster mattress and high quality natural fiber bedding. You'll also enjoy the vintage vanity (hello gorgeous!)  and rack for your clothing. 

The front room has a plush leather couch, live plants, obscenely large smart TV with Netflix and Hulu, vintage turntable and records, and a quintessential Chicago neighborhood view. 

The bathroom could be in a historical museum exhibit. It was installed so long ago that every pipe is visible (con) but contains a big gold glitter clawfoot bathtub (pro). Consider it an experience. 

The second bedroom is lovingly referred to as ""The Cozy Room"" it contains one plush twin size daybed with a mountain of pillows, an antique dresser and a rad, mod lamp, and a cherub chandelier. Thats it, because that is all it can hold. This room is small, mighty and separated from the main living space with curtains. 

Have you ever wondered what buildings looked like in Wicker Park before they were torn down and new condos were erected? This is your chance to live it. The floors aren't level, the walls are made of plaster, the windows are older than your grandparents. In no way is this an ""All Mod Cons"" apartment, but it is chock full of character, history and love. 

As a antique and vintage dealer for nearly 3 decades, some of the art and furniture may change occasionally and I'll do my best to update the pictures accordingly. If there is a particular piece you're interested in, there is a fair shot of brining it home as a souvenir. If you ask nicely for a list of secret-awesome-thrift stores, you might get a tip.

You have exclusive to the entire second floor of the pink house.

My family lives on the property and you'll be able to see as little or as much of us as you'd like. The garden and yard is shared with 2 other units so there is a good chance you'll meet some neighbors as well!

The East Village neighborhood is packed with restaurants, bars, nightlife, independent shopping, and corporate necessities like Target, Walgreens and Starbucks.  All of these businesses are less than a 10 minute walk away. 

Its easy to take a quick stroll, and stop by Hoosier Mama Bakery, Forbidden Root Brewery, Yuzu Sushi, Do√±a Naty's Mexican Restaurant, and get a look at the famous Shit Fountain, without getting anywhere near that day's step goal.

Getting into the heart of bustling Wicker Park aka The Crotch, is a lovely walk away.

You are a 4 minute walk to the Chicago Ave bus which will take you down to Navy Pier, a 10 minute walk to the Division Street Blue Line Stop, and 2 minutes to the Ashland Bus.

I work full time so you might not see me much. If I am home in the evening I sometime watch tv, and the sound seems to travel very well. To be considerate to my guest I do not watch it past 10.

The neighborhood  is  quiet and residential yet close to all the fun and lively new entertainment in the city. It is on the north west end of Bucktown close to Logan Square and Wicker Park.

The blue line is a few blocks away, it gets you downtown in an few minutes and to O'Hare Airport in about 20 minutes.  The Fullerton bus is two blocks away and get to the the red line in a few minutes. Parking is non permitted and there is always street parking close by.

This opportunity is good for long term, students or work.","This is a quiet house, so if you are a noisy it will not be a good fit.

FAQs
Q: Is the neighborhood safe?
A: Very much so. 24 hours a day.

Q: PARKING?
A: Your reservation comes with one spot in the lot next door to the building. If a spot is not available when you arrive, you can use SpotAngels to find a temporary spot until a spot opens up for you :)

Q: Do I need to bring towels, a hair dryer, or linens?
A: Nope! we provide all these things. Same with hotel-size toiletries (unless I happen to be out, which is rare).

Q: When can I check in or check out? 
A: Check in is 4pm and check out is 10am. Early check ins can be difficult if there are guests who checked out same day. We ask for an early check-in, or a late-check out fee, if you request either.

Q: Can I come and go as I please?
A: Yes. And we wouldn't trust any listing with which this isn't the case.

Q: Is the place professionally cleaned between guests?
A: Yes, and we take pride in providing a clean home for guests.

Q: What's my total booking price? 
A: We honestly have no idea. With fees included, it only shows the guest how much they pay. This figure should be present after you enter your dates. Note that, pricing varies on a daily basis, and it actually uses some crazy algorithm to adjust it automatically, so I don't actually control this.

Q: Are the beds comfortable?
A: Very. Some guests say they're the best they've ever slept on!

Tucked on Chicago's North Side between North Center and Lakeview, the little pocket that is Roscoe Village is a collection of laid-back taverns, destination brunch restaurants and cozy cafes that all seem to have pretty sidewalk patios and friendly beer gardens during the warm weather months, and a sense of neighborly camraderie during the winter months. Dining ranges from traditional comfort food to Turkish, burgers to bakeries, Cuban to creamy custards ‚Äî all serving up casual hospitality.

The Addison Brown Line stop is about a half-mile / 7 minute walk due east - easily accessible on the 152/Addison bus, which has a stop heading east pretty much across the street! The 49/Wester bus is nearby too, so it's easy to get around here without a car. If you do bring a car, however, there's plenty of street parking in the neighborhood.

In addition to easy access to and from Wrigley Field, we're  also close to music venues like the Beat Kitchen, the Metro, and the Vic Theatre, and conveniently located near the Southport Corridor, including the Music Box Theatre. It's a 10 minute drive to DePaul, 12 minutes to Belmont Harbor and the beach, and 15 minutes to Lincoln Park Zoo. And, since we're just east of the up-and-coming Avondale neighborhood, you'll find plenty of innovative restaurants and bars.","PLEASE NOTE THAT WE CHARGE PER GUEST AFTER A SET NUMBER.

Walk Score 94! Huge private bedroom/bathroom suite in our very large Wicker Park condo. 14' high ceilings and queen sized bed, private bathroom, closet for storage. Wifi, Apple TV and the like provided. Located in the middle of Wicker Park's best attractions, bus/rail, and dining. 

We're a late-20s working professional couple with two awesome babies and a great condo in Chicago's best hood. We're always game for hosting new and great people and would very much like to hear from you!

Wicker Park is hands down the best place in Chicago for foodies, plus we've got great access to the cities many culinary attractions. Our next door neighbor is an Italian cafe frequently referred to as having 'one of Chicago's best patios'. The lakefront/Lincoln Park/Gold Coast/Mag Mile is 10-20 minutes by bus depending on the time and day you are going. Our house is an 8 minute walk from two blue line stops to get you to/from O'hare and Downtown quickly. If going to Midway add a transfer to the Orange line for about 50 minutes total on the train.

Private bed and bath, kitchen and dining area (we love group meals!), baby gear (stroller, toys, changing table, port-a-crib), your own set of keys to come and go as you please, AppleTV, outdoor patios, Laundry, car rental (Zipcar), bike share (Divvy), transit/CTA and plenty of street parking

Up to them, but we love hosting folks and often find time to share a meal and maybe a movie. Usually if we're doing events around town we'll invite guests or even just for coffee/drinks with friends. One lucky couple got to go sailing with us :O

They call Brooklyn the Wicker Park of the East :P - We love our hood, it's full of energy, great food, art, cafes bars and just minutes from downtown and the lakefront or any other great Chicago attraction (Wrigley field!)

There's a bus stop on the street in front of our house. We also have bike-share on our block (Divvy) and are about 7 mins walking to the Damen or Division CTA Blue Line stops which connect downtown and to the airports.","We don't have many 'rules' but I do provide a very detailed guide that explains getting to the house, entry, kitchen, cleanup, et cetera kinds of things you might like to know. Our only request is that you respect the quiet times for the babies and treat them as you would your own. Thanks!","Up to them, but we love hosting folks and often find time to share a meal and maybe a movie.

I know this city like the back of my hand. Feel free to ask for info.

Because the condo is adjacent to the University of Chicago campus, there is a youthful and lively air to the community. You are likely to see many students and professors walking through the neighborhood, as well as inside the restaurants and businesses of the area.

The best way to get around the immediate area is by car, but if you wish to venture into the bustling streets of the downtown area, public transportation is the best way to avoid traffic. The Metra Electric Line, which  takes you straight into the heart of downtown Chicago, has a station at the Midway Plaisance, next to the intersection of 59th Street and Harper Avenue.

Coffee, tea and assorted snacks. I.E. granola bars, trail mix and Belvita bars provided.

"Let's do this:

CHECK-IN: 3:00 pm, but it can be earlier depending on whether a guest was there that morning, how quickly I can get the unit cleaned, etc. If you need to drop off bags earlier in the day we're happy to store them.

CHECK-OUT: 12:00 pm. I'm flexible if no one is coming in later that day, but if I've got another guest coming at 3:00 I'm afraid I have to throw ya' out by noon. If you need to leave your luggage here because you have a late flight just let me know.

CANCELLATION: We're considered ""moderate"" on the Airbnb scale.

SMOKING: Not in the apartment, please. There is a sitting area and ashtray right outside the back door, or you can go on the front porch.

PETS: Not allowed, sorry. 

ACCOMMODATIONS: The beds comfortably sleep three people, but it's possible to squeeze a second person in The Library and an additional person on the futon in the living room. We account for 4 guests in the room rental price but would charge an extra $25 per night for guest #5. No more than five guests are allowed. If the futon will be needed please notify us ahead of time so we can have it made up as a bed for you.

VISITORS: Feel free to invite over a few friends or family, but in order to be respectful to our neighbors we can't allow loud parties. If you want to reserve the backyard for a small get-together in the warm months just run it by us first (but unfortunately no grill is available).",1 bath,3 beds,2 bedrooms,5 guests,9695421,Historic &

Convenient street parking--only cars with special permits can park on our block, and we provide you with those permits. We've lovingly preserved our 1907 greystone & look forward to hosting you in beautiful Chicago!

Coming to see HAMILTON? The Blue Line (1 block away) will whisk you to the same block as the CIBC Theatre. Ask us for details!

Our classic Chicago greystone lies on a quiet residential street, half a block off Logan Square proper. My partner Cory and I strive to keep our home clean and comfortable, and the decor is very much a reflection of our personalities and our years of living here. Vintage furniture and artwork combined with a host of amenities have long been enjoyed by visiting family and friends, and we hope to extend the same level of hospitality to our Airbnb guests. We'll always be nearby and are happy to assist in any way we can!

(Tip: The Airbnb Map only shows the approximate locations of properties, and their placement is wildly inaccurate. Don't trust the map! We're on Troy Street, half a block north of Logan Boulevard. Many of the properties that appear near us on the map are actually quite far away, so proceed with caution!)

You'll meet me at check-in, but after that the amount of interaction we have is entirely up to you. I'm more than happy to give recommendations or directions or even a brief history of the house itself, but if you don't ask I'll simply vanish. You can also text me anytime if you need concierge tips (i.e. ""I'm at Willis Tower, how do I get home?"").

We're situated on the same block as the world-famous Longman & Eagle--but on the quiet, residential side--which also puts us half a block from Logan Square itself. The Centennial Monument, the legendary Lula Cafe, The Logan Theatre, Lost Lake, the Logan Square Comfort Station, Billy Sunday, Fat Rice, the Logan Square Farmer's Market, Mi Tocaya Antojeria, Quiote, Revolution Brewing, the Chicago Diner (vegan), and countless other bars and restaurants are all within a half mile from our front door. Of course there are also coffee shops, book stores, arcades, and even a medical marijuana dispensary, but if you're looking for something special just ask and we'll steer you in the right direction!

Tip: The phrase ""Logan Square"" refers to both the square and to the enormous neighborhood surrounding it, which can be confusing. There are parts of Logan Square the Neighborhood that generally aren't as convenient for tourists, so don't assume that all rentals ""in Logan Square"" are comparable.

Another tip: Hosts on Airbnb have the option of either showing the exact location of their property on the map, or showing its ""approximate location"" in a large blueish circle that spans half the neighborhood. Be cautious of hosts choosing to use the blue circle as that may mean their location isn't very convenient. We've always proudly advertised our exact address--we even posted a satellite photo--because our block is second to none!

ON FOOT: Part of the reason we live here is because so many things are in easy walking distance. We provide a custom map showing some of our favorite nearby restaurants, bars and other necessities (pharmacy, theaters, bank, landmarks) and encourage you to go out exploring! It's a very safe area--the countless people walking dogs mean you're never alone--so don't hesitate to hoof it.

BY BIKE: Chicago has a network of Divvy bike rental kiosks blanketing the city, and our nearest location is one block away. The Divvy stations in the immediate area are also depicted on our homemade map.

BY TRAIN: We're less than a block from an underground Blue Line stop, which means easy access to the train but without all the noise. The Blue Line is the train that runs to O'Hare International Airport, so if you're flying in to O'Hare getting here is a very quick and easy ride. The Blue Line also runs to Wicker Park and then on into downtown.

BUS: There's a bus terminal for the CTA #56 (West Loop) and #76 (Lincoln Park) buses right above the entrance to the Blue Line stop, one block away.

CAB: There's a cab stand across the street from Longman & Eagle just around the corner, and of course Uber and Lyft are very popular here if you want them to come to your door.

CAR: If you drove to Chicago or have a rental car, we'll provide you with complimentary parking passes that will allow you to park on our street. Because the street is permit-only it makes parking near our home quite easy.

Have allergies or sensitivities? We primarily use unscented and sensitive skin-type detergents and cleansers, and a full list of the products we use on your floor is available upon request.

We do have two medium-sized dogs. If you meet them in the yard they are extremely friendly, but if you're not ""a dog person"" just let us know and we'll happily keep them at bay.

Noise is a complaint in a lot of negative Airbnb reviews, so to avoid any unpleasant surprises we want to address noise directly: In our home you will not hear the train (it's elevated in most of Chicago, but the Logan Square stop is underground) and sirens are few and far between. And while our dogs keep the building extremely safe and we keep them quiet while we have guests, you still might hear the dogs bark briefly when the front door opens or when someone rings the doorbell. One of the joys of dog ownership!

And this should come as no surprise, but you might also hear our footsteps. We have rugs blanketing the 2nd floor to muffle and do our best to tiptoe, but the reality is that it's an old building and you are likely going to hear the occasional steps and floorboard squeaks as you would in any first floor unit.","Let's do this:

CHECK-IN: 3:00 pm, but it can be earlier depending on whether a guest was there that morning, how quickly I can get the unit cleaned, etc. If you need to drop off bags earlier in the day we're happy to store them.

CHECK-OUT: 12:00 pm. I'm flexible if no one is coming in later that day, but if I've got another guest coming at 3:00 I'm afraid I have to throw ya' out by noon. If you need to leave your luggage here because you have a late flight just let me know.

CANCELLATION: We're considered ""moderate"" on the Airbnb scale.

SMOKING: Not in the apartment, please. There is a sitting area and ashtray right outside the back door, or you can go on the front porch.

PETS: Not allowed, sorry. 

ACCOMMODATIONS: The beds comfortably sleep three people, but it's possible to squeeze a second person in The Library and an additional person on the futon in the living room. We account for 4 guests in the room rental price but would charge an extra $25 per night for guest #5. No more than five guests are allowed. If the futon will be needed please notify us ahead of time so we can have it made up as a bed for you.

VISITORS: Feel free to invite over a few friends or family, but in order to be respectful to our neighbors we can't allow loud parties. If you want to reserve the backyard for a small get-together in the warm months just run it by us first (but unfortunately no grill is available).","You'll meet me at check-in, but after that the amount of interaction we have is entirely up to you. I'm more than happy to give recommendations or directions or even a brief history of the house itself, but if you don't ask I'll simply vanish. You can also text me anytime if you need concierge tips (i.e. ""I'm at Willis Tower, how do I get home?"").","We're situated on the same block as the world-famous Longman & Eagle--but on the quiet, residential side--which also puts us half a block from Logan Square itself.

My partner Cory and I strive to keep our home clean and comfortable, and the decor is very much a reflection of our personalities and our years of living here. Vintage furniture and artwork combined with a host of amenities have long been enjoyed by visiting family and friends, and we hope to extend the same level of hospitality to our Airbnb guests. We'll always be nearby and are happy to assist in any way we can!

(Tip: The Airbnb Map only shows the approximate locations of properties, and their placement is wildly inaccurate. Don't trust the map! We're on Troy Street, half a block north of Logan Boulevard. Many of the properties that appear near us on the map are actually quite far away, so proceed with caution!)","Situated mere feet from Logan Square itself and the (quiet) underground Logan Square Blue Line train stop for easy 24/7 downtown and O'Hare access. Convenient street parking--only cars with special permits can park on our block, and we provide you with those permits. We've lovingly preserved our 1907 greystone & look forward to hosting you in beautiful Chicago!

Coming to see HAMILTON? The Blue Line (1 block away) will whisk you to the same block as the CIBC Theatre.

-----------
PARKING
There's a parking lot across the street which you can book in advance on an app.  It doesn't get much easier than that in Chicago.  Street parking is hard to find and not recommended.
----------
CHECK-IN TIME 
Typically, guests may receive the keys and drop their bags in the apartment as early as 12PM (noon). The cleaners do need until 4PM to do their work. 
If you'd like to drop your bags early, we can usually accommodate you!
If you'd like to take a nap or shower right away, and the night before your stay isn't booked yet, let's discuss booking that night before! Then you could arrive as early as you'd like that day! 
----------
CHECK-OUT TIME
11AM is check-out. If you'll need a check-out after 11AM, and the night after your stay isn't booked yet, let's chat about booking that next night! Then you could leave as late as you'd like that day!
Unfortunately we *do not* have anywhere to hold bags after your stay - sorry!
----------
ROLLAWAY BED
The twin rollaway bed is prepared before every stay with fresh linens.
The bed is physically locked into the upright position to help make the bed super easy to move around, and placed in the closet. Simply roll it into place and open. Everything will be ready for you. 
----------
OCCUPANCY 
Upon booking, your reservation will have paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number whether visiting or sleeping,  you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first. 
We consider the maximum capacity of the apartment to be its sleeping capacity - five individuals. Anyone past five would not be permitted. 
Enjoy the city! Please don‚Äôt bring a party back..
----------
RATES
Rates and minimum stays change constantly - every night is different! 
The nightly rate may change based on number of guests, which is verified upon arrival. Please do your best to let me know how many guests will be staying in advance!
----------
The pictures you see have accurate furniture, appliances, finishes, square footage - really everything! The art and positioning of items *might* be slightly different. Please don‚Äôt be concerned!

Chinatown
Chicago‚Äôs Chinatown is one of the largest neighborhoods of its kind in the US. Located on the city‚Äôs near South Side, the vibrant and energetic culture is reflected in the area‚Äôs many specialty shops, cultural cuisine and signature landmarks, like Ping Tom Memorial Park and a Buddhist Temple.
The main drag of Wentworth Avenue is a dim sum drenched display of Chinese food perfection. Along this epic street, you will discover restaurants, distinctive boutique shopping and the Chinatown Gate, a beautifully ornamented entryway to the neighborhood.
Just north of the Wentworth Avenue District is Chinatown Square, the largest Chinese mall in the Midwest. Besides hosting top restaurants, like Ken Kee, Phoenix or Lao Sze Chuan, you will find an incredible collection of public art that includes zodiac-inspired animal sculptures and twin pagodas. The area's signature piece, an enormous tile mosaic created by celebrated artists Yan Dong and Zhou Ping, represents the accomplishments of Chinese people in America. Rather poetically, the mural embodies the neighborhood as a significant gift to Chicago.

We're conveniently located near the intersection of Cermak Road and Wentworth Ave. Public transportation (bus, train) are less than a block away. Major highways  (I-90/94, I-290, I-55) all converge in this area. For the foodies, this is the place to be with many restaurants within walking distance and close by the downtown and South Loop area. Conventioneers will be glad to know that McCormick Place is a 16 minute walk/6 minutes drive away. See below for more details.

Walking
Many of the city‚Äôs top attractions are a short walk or ride away from each other. Weather-permitting, walking is the best way to see the city and the hidden treasures of architecture and public art in the downtown area.
When planning your route, keep in mind that every 8 blocks equals 1 mile.

Chicago Public Transportation (CTA)
The buses and trains of the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) are a fast and cost-effective way to get into and around the city. Known as the ‚ÄúL‚Äù (though they may be elevated or underground) the trains are a fun way to see The Loop from a new vantage point.
CTA visitor passes offer the best value, with unlimited rides on all CTA trains and buses. A 1-day pass is $10, a 3-day pass is $20, and a 7-day pass is $28.
Passes are easy to use. They activate the first time you use them and are valid for the number of consecutive days purchased. Just dip your pass into the bus fare machine or the train station turnstile.
Check the CTA website for the latest fares, travel alerts, and trip planners.

Taxis
Taxis are abundant throughout most of Chicago so finding a cab is typically easy. Taxi rates depend on gas prices and number of passengers and can get a bit pricey but provide a fast and convenient way to get around the city, particularly beyond downtown.

Biking
If time and weather permit, consider renting a bike. Chicago‚Äôs lakefront boasts 26 uninterrupted miles of easy bike and walking trails.
Half-day rentals are available from Bike and Roll at Navy Pier and Millennium Park.


From the Airports

O‚ÄôHare International Airport: 
Chicago‚Äôs O‚ÄôHare is one of the world‚Äôs busiest airports. It‚Äôs about 15 miles northwest of the Loop in downtown Chicago. O‚ÄôHare has 5 terminals, all of which have information booths and multilingual employees to assist you.

Midway International Airport:
Although it‚Äôs smaller than O‚ÄôHare, Midway is closer to the Loop and services more discount airlines (but fewer airlines overall). If you‚Äôre looking for a good deal on plane tickets, check out flights to Midway.

Chicago‚Äôs Chinatown is one of the largest neighborhoods of its kind in the US. Located on the city‚Äôs near South Side, the vibrant and energetic culture is reflected in the area‚Äôs many specialty shops, cultural cuisine and signature landmarks, like Ping Tom Memorial Park and a Buddhist Temple.
The main drag of Wentworth Avenue is a dim sum drenched display of Chinese food perfection. Along this epic street, you will discover restaurants, distinctive boutique shopping and the Chinatown Gate, a beautifully ornamented entryway to the neighborhood.
Just north of the Wentworth Avenue District is Chinatown Square, the largest Chinese mall in the Midwest. Besides hosting top restaurants, like Ken Kee, Phoenix or Lao Sze Chuan, you will find an incredible collection of public art that includes zodiac-inspired animal sculptures and twin pagodas. The area's signature piece, an enormous tile mosaic created by celebrated artists Yan Dong and Zhou Ping, represents the accomplishments of Chinese people in America. Rather poetically, the mural embodies the neighborhood as a significant gift to Chicago.","‚Ä¢ Check-in time 3 PM or later

Walking
Many of the city‚Äôs top attractions are a short walk or ride away from each other. Weather-permitting, walking is the best way to see the city and the hidden treasures of architecture and public art in the downtown area.
When planning your route, keep in mind that every 8 blocks equals 1 mile.

Chicago Public Transportation (CTA)
The buses and trains of the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) are a fast and cost-effective way to get into and around the city. Known as the ‚ÄúL‚Äù (though they may be elevated or underground) the trains are a fun way to see The Loop from a new vantage point.
CTA visitor passes offer the best value, with unlimited rides on all CTA trains and buses. A 1-day pass is $10, a 3-day pass is $20, and a 7-day pass is $28.
Passes are easy to use. They activate the first time you use them and are valid for the number of consecutive days purchased. Just dip your pass into the bus fare machine or the train station turnstile.
Check the CTA website for the latest fares, travel alerts, and trip planners.

Taxis
Taxis are abundant throughout most of Chicago so finding a cab is typically easy. Taxi rates depend on gas prices and number of passengers and can get a bit pricey but provide a fast and convenient way to get around the city, particularly beyond downtown.

Biking
If time and weather permit, consider renting a bike. Chicago‚Äôs lakefront boasts 26 uninterrupted miles of easy bike and walking trails.
Half-day rentals are available from Bike and Roll at Navy Pier and Millennium Park.


From the Airports

O‚ÄôHare International Airport: 
Chicago‚Äôs O‚ÄôHare is one of the world‚Äôs busiest airports. It‚Äôs about 15 miles northwest of the Loop in downtown Chicago. O‚ÄôHare has 5 terminals, all of which have information booths and multilingual employees to assist you.

Midway International Airport:
Although it‚Äôs smaller than O‚ÄôHare, Midway is closer to the Loop and services more discount airlines (but fewer airlines overall).

It‚Äôs close enough to the city for weekday commutes yet far enough to give you space to relax after a long week. And with a grocery store right across the street, you will always be minutes away from food or any other necessities you may need throughout your stay. 

More information

If you enjoy cooking, we have a Jewel-Osco grocery store right across the street. They sell fresh produce, countless snacks, and have a fantastic beer, wine, and spirits collection. So if you‚Äôre craving an afternoon libation but don‚Äôt want to venture far, you‚Äôre in luck!

Within half a mile you will find two local restaurants where you can enjoy a meal with locals. The first is the Gale Street Inn Chicago. This neighborhood rib joint has been serving signature ribs in a friendly atmosphere since 1963. And if you can‚Äôt make their 3pm-5:45pm happy hour, no need to worry, the happiness continues from 9pm-11pm at the bar.

Another local favorite is Galvin's Public House. This family-owned Irish pub loves serving up pints, showing sports games, and entertaining guests with their live DJ nights. They have daily drink and food specials, so be sure to check their website for an updated listing. Oh, and did we mention they have a fireplace in the dining room?

Craving some international cuisine? Pho No.1 Vietnamese Cuisine is right around the corner from Galvin‚Äôs. Pho No. 1 is where you can grab a quick, healthy bite and be in and out in no time. They have a variety of healthy options and are known for their large portions and fast service.

Jefferson Park is a 6 min walk from our place and is a nice little spot to relax on the weekends. Grab a picnic lunch and enjoy reading a book while you soak up some sunshine. You might also be lucky enough to stumble upon their Sunday farmer‚Äôs market. Roberts Square Park is just under a mile but worth the trip. The park‚Äôs lush green grass makes it perfect for people watching or getting in a refreshing run.

Our place is a 12-minute drive from O‚ÄôHare International Airport and a short drive into Downtown Chicago.

Although we have a Jewel-Osco grocery store across the street and some restaurants nearby, we recommend either renting a car or taking rideshares (Uber or Lyft).

Within a 10-minute ride from our place, you will have access to a variety of different restaurants and public parks. And the Kennedy Expressway (I-90/94) is only 3 minutes away.

If you‚Äôre going to be making weekly trips into Downtown and looking for convenience, driving will take anywhere from 45 minutes to 90 minutes depending on traffic. Although we offer free parking in a garage, taking the train into Downtown might be your best bet. From our place, it‚Äôs a nice 10-minute walk to Jefferson Park Station, then a 30-minute ride into the city.

There are tons of toys available for families with toddlers (neatly stored away when not in use). There's a nice little backyard too.

We're definitely open to socialize and show you around the town but can totally stay out of your way and give you as much space and privacy as you need too.

-Leave the apartment at least as nice as it was when you arrived.  As the boyscouts say, ""try to leave this world a little better than you found it.""  This is a more self sufficient Airbnb than many (which is why it is so affordable!) so teamwork is required.  You are expected to clean up after yourself and help contribute to keeping the place clean.  

-Please make the bed with the clean sheets provided before you check out.  Leave your sheets and towels in the hamper.  

-Default check in is 3pm, checkout at 12pm noon.  We are flexible and can easily accommodate early check in and late checkout upon request.

-Shoes off at the door

-Make sure all dishes are washed and put away before checkout

-No unregistered guests are allowed on the property without approval (and obviously no parties!)

-No eating or drinking within the bedrooms. 

-Smoking is not allowed in the property.  If you smoke outside the property, cigarette butts must be discarded in the bucket provided or into your own receptacle.

Guests are allowed access to the entire apartment with exception of the furnace room and cleaning closet.

We are always available via airbnb app but if for some reason there is a question, concern, or problem we can be reached on the phone or via text we speak Fluent Spanish as well.

This neighborhood is called Lawndale. I love the neighborhood it has so much character full of beautiful grey stone two and three flats, and old world Chicago charm. If your a pizza person there is a Famous Lou Malnatis about 10 mins away. Lou does one of the best deep dish butter crust sausage pizzas ever conceived. Also there is Douglas Park about eight blocks east of the unit which is where Riot Fest is hosted.

One of the best things about this unit is the that the bus stop is only steps aways which will take you on a short three minute ride right to the Pink Line which you can take downtown and then to anywhere the ""L"" train goes. If your more of a driver I do have a gated parking spot on premises for you which you can access the unit almost right from your car. But like anywhere in the city always keep your eyes peeled when on public transportation.

There are kids in the building so it will never be as quiet as a library. Also please remember you are on the first floor with tenants living on the second floor and the basement. Please. NO shoes in the unit we have provided plastic trays at both entrances for shoes.","SELF CHECK IN

The block is a historic landmark itself, with this particular house  being built back in 1885!  Besides the attractions listed above, it is also located near Rush Hospital and UIC.

Because of it's central location in the city, there is lots to walk to.

Our 2 bedroom apartment in Ravenswood, one of Chicago's vibrant and neighborly Northside neighborhoods, is ideal for your group! There's space for 6, and a newly renovated kitchen - though you may not have time to cook, with all of the family-owned restaurants nearby! Also nearby is the Montrose Brown Line station, which will take you down to the Loop in about a half-hour, and Lakeview / Lincoln Park in even less.

Once inside the building (a classic Chicago 3 flat), you'll go down a few steps, and into the apartment. The first room you'll see is our open kitchen / living room, with dining table separating the two. There's exposed brick throughout. Toward the front of the apartment is one bedroom, with a Queen-sized bed. Toward the rear is the second bedroom, also with a Queen-sized bed, and the apartment's full bath. There's a building laundry in a room beyond the apartment, and plenty of signage leading you there.

You'll have full access to my 2 bedroom, 1 bath apartment, as well as the common building laundry room.

Designed to be Chicago's first commuter suburb, Ravenswood became a primarily German neighborhood after being annexed by the city. Today, it's popular particularly with young couples who are looking for the urban experience to raise their families as well as the singles set who are attracted by the Lincoln Avenue entertainment strip, and a pleasure to walk around in, thanks to plenty of still-remaining Victorian architecture!

The Montrose Brown Line stop is about a 3 minute walk east. The 78/Montrose bus has a stop at the end of the block, and the 50/Damen bus has a stop just a 3 minute walk west, so it's easy to get around here without a car. If you do bring a car, however, there's plenty of street parking in the neighborhood.

In addition to easy access to and from the Loop, we're also close to picturesque Lincoln Square, and conveniently located down the street from Lillistreet Art Center and the Old Town School of Folk Music. It's 20 minutes on public transit, or a half-hour walk to Wrigley Field, a 10 minute drive to entertainment venues like the Music Box Theatre and the Metro, and a 10 minute walk to the Black Ensemble Theatre. And, since the neighborhood is diverse, you can find any number of restaurants - from places celebrating the neighborhood's German history, to brunch spots that mill their own flour, to West African.","House Rules: Very simply, please respect my home and my neighbors.

Newport between Halsted & Clark
New to airbnb is my vintage Chicago greystone garden flat with private entrance and modern amenities on a historically landmarked street in the Lake View/Boystown neighborhood.

We're the hidden gem located on a quiet street between the bustle of Wrigleyville and Boystown. Our humble home - built in 1890 is the garden unit of a restored Lake View vintage greystone building. Walk to all local amenities, transportation, the beach, shops, cafes, restaurants and nightlife. Two double bedrooms and a full stone bath make this completely modernized space perfect for 1-4 people.

This spacious bedroom is equipped with a smart tv, iron, ironing board and extra sheets. We also have a coffee machine with coffee for our coffee lovers. This room has central air conditioning and heating vents. The bathroom is shared but as stated in my reviews my house is spotless.
 Note:**You may only use the kitchens microwave and fridge space provided**
I do Airbnb in more than 1 room in this apartment. Please read house rules.All I do ask all those that book my place to shut the bedroom and bathroom doors gently, and walk gently (not heavy footed) .



FYI -From time to time I will dog-sit a small harmless chihuahua . She is a friendly, quiet, respectful. She doesn‚Äôt roam around the house at all. You will hardly see or hear her.

Most of the time I will be home to accommodate my guest.

The Galewood neighborhood is a diverse residential area. You may think of it as a hub, making access to mulitple attractions easy- going east takes you to Wicker Park/ Bucktown creative centers and into the Chicago Loop.  Then directly south you‚Äôll find Oak Park under 2 miles, it is known for  Frank Lloyd Wright Homes, unique boutiques, restaurants for great food, theaters, tourism and Breweries. 11 miles away from both midway and O‚ÄôHare airport.

Getting around the city is easy but time consuming especially with public transportation. If you use uber or lyft or even have a vehicle those are your best methods to get around fast and reliable. 

Public transportation is easy to take if you follow my advice and directions. Google maps makes it harder on those unfamiliar with the area.  If you do plan on taking public trans ask me and I will best advise you on getting around the city from my house.

I do request that you have a profile picture up during booking so we know who to expect.
Remember this is a private bedroom in the house I live in, which means you‚Äôll see me from time to time. I am understanding of everyone‚Äôs privacy/sleep schedules, I will keep it as quiet as possible and I expect the same in return. So please keep it quiet ü§´. 


Also if you plan on checking in early please let me know before hand. Same applies for late check outs. 
 The apartment is a 3 bedroom 2 bath house. I Airbnb two bedrooms out of 3. So as I‚Äôve stated it is imperative you respect privacy and sleep schedules.

Although not included in the rental, we have a lovely basketball court and side yard for our children‚Äôs enjoyment. You are welcome to use it with prior permission with the understanding that our family has priority. We ask that you keep in tidy and return it to its original condition.
 
Please note that the non-smoking policy applies both inside and outside: please do not smoke in the yard.

We are on the less congested side of Lincoln Park, one of Chicago's nicest neighborhoods. You'll find fine and casual dinning options within a short walk. DePaul university is within 4 blocks.

Don't miss the new Bloomingdales Trail (or ""the 606,"" as locals refer to it), a 2.7 mile walk/jog/bike path, only a few blocks away. This former elevated train line has just been converted to one of the cities great public spaces. 

We are right next to a grocery store and a large selection of dinning options nearby. Coffee and pastries at Floriole cafe are not to be missed.

Street parking is unusually easy with plenty of spots available day or night. The metra train is 4 blocks away and the ""L"" train red line is 6 blocks. From either airport you can exit the blue line at Division and Ashland and take a bus north to Webster.

I usually recommend using uber to get around. Usually $10-$15 to get downtown.

One of Chicago's creative epicenters lies just west of downtown Chicago in Wicker Park and Bucktown. These synonymous neighborhoods are famous for unparalleled boutique shopping, esoteric book stores and their countless art galleries ‚Äî many housed within the Flat Iron Arts Building.

The North Avenue and also the Ashland  buses run about every 10 Minutes and are less than a block away.  The Blue line El stop at Damen is a 10 min walk away, the El stop at Milwaukee is also 10 min walk but not down as nice of a street. Taxi downtown is $10/10 min, taxi to Lincoln Park/Wrigleyville is $10/10 min. Taxi to Ohare or Midway is $40 and can range from 30 minutes without traffic to 1 hour with bumper to bumper traffic.

Anchored by a beautiful stretch of shoreline to the east and dotted with train stops from two ‚ÄòL' lines, Lakeview is one of Chicago's liveliest and most accessible neighborhoods. Several distinct areas ‚Äî East Lakeview, Central Lakeview, Boystown and Wrigleyville ‚Äî meld together to form a lakefront community that celebrates diversity and boasts something for every type of visitor.

Arts and culture come in the form of live music venues, several summer street festivals and a thriving scene for theater, dance and comedy.

Not to be outdone by its extraordinary entertainment landscape, Lakeview makes full use of its slice of Lincoln Park, a 1,200-acre oasis dedicated to the outdoors. Here you will find the scenic Lakefront Trail, a golf course and driving range, a boat harbor, a bird sanctuary, tennis courts and grassy playing fields that are also perfect for picnics or just soaking in the views.

Chicago is a walking city with an easy-to-navigate public transportation system.  The Belmont L station, serving both the Red and Brown train lines, is 3 blocks away.  Two CTA bus routes are 1/2 block away - Halsted #8, Broadway #36. A Divvy Bike station is 1/2 block away and the Lakefront running path is 2 blocks away. 15 Minute walk to Wrigley Field.","Please treat my home and my neighbors with respect.

""No wonder this is one of Chicago's favorite north side neighborhoods!""
Lincoln Square combines old world charm, fantastic city parks, amazing local restaurants, and is rated ""a walker's paradise"" by WalkScore - a 98! It includes a variety of micro-neighborhoods and Chicago history - Rosehill Cemetery and Bowmanville, Welles Park and Sulzer Regional Library, a lovely portion of the Chicago River, and terrific locally-owned shops and restaurants in the Square itself. Old Town School of Folk Music, Cafe Selmarie, historic Kraus Music (Studio V), Chopping Block and the famous Lincoln Statue are some of my favorite landmarks. The Brown Line cuts through Lincoln Square making transportation anywhere in Chicago a breeze. Kids come from all over Chicago to play baseball and football in the Welles Park sports programs.

5 minute walk to Brown Line train (the ""L"") that will take you downtown in ~20 minutes. There is free parking on the street.

The apartment is located just east of Western Ave. and just off of Lawrence. The main strip of Lincoln square restaurants is a couple blocks away and even those couple blocks have some of our favorite bars (definitely recommend The 6th) and restaurants. 5 minute walks to Mariano's for groceries and Corepower Yoga. CVS is around the corner for essentials.

The common spaces are completely open for you to use! The kitchen has a long marble counter, perfect for a quick snack. The living room TV is a Roku smart TV and has a Chromecast set up as well so you can stream from your phone / laptop easily.

There is a smart lock for easy access easy and out. Also a Nest thermostat for the heat / AC.

The overall neighborhood is walkable with many fun coffee shops, restaurants, and bars that are walking distance. Some of my favorites within a block of the place are the Delta (cocktails, modern Southern food), Gallery Cafe (independent cafe), and Louie's (neighborhood bar with karaoke). For those who want to walk a little further (5-15 min), Violet Hour is one of the best cocktail bars in the city, Dove's Luncheonette is a modern Mexican diner, Publican Anker is a gastropub, and there are a million more options all walking distance! 

The blue line L station (i.e., subway) is about a 5-7 min walk and goes directly to O'Hare airport or downtown into the city.

Public transportation is very convenient in this neighborhood. The blue line L (i.e., subway) goes directly to O'Hare airport as well as downtown Chicago. 

There is also several buses within a few blocks (including the North Ave bus, which is <100 feet from the condo).

If you are new to Airbnb, there are some things you should know about listing your profile and making a request.

AirBnB will block your email, phone number, and personal contact information, so we are unable to communicate other than through Airbnb.

We, like most hosts, love to see profiles which are updated with some more personal information about yourself and a couple forms of verification, especially a verified ID. We like to see that to ensure a measure of security for ourselves and our guests. Once you have stayed with a host, you are rated by the host. That rating helps to increase the appeal of your profile. We are happy to give you any further information you may need.

We have a curfew of 10pm. If you are going to be coming home late, please arrange with us in advance.","Check In/Check Out may be flexible if agreed upon in advance.

Check In anytime after 3 pm. Please let us know when you book about when you are arriving so we are home to welcome you. If you would like to arrange for an earlier check in, please let us know.

Curfew at 10 pm unless you arrange with host for a later time.

ACCESS - Front Door.

Please remove your shoes in our home (closet for shoes in foyer)

We do not allow pets as we already have small dogs

Registered guests only, please

We live in a residential neighborhood, so we ask that you keep noise to a reasonable level out of respect for our other guests and our neighbors.

We do not allow smoking inside the house, but you are welcome to smoke on the front or back porch.

Check out is at 10 am. This is so we can access the room to change sheets and clean room for the next guest. You are always welcome to stay in the house later, but especially on work days, we will need to access the room early to prepare for a new guest arrival. If you would like a later check out, we will make every possible effort to accommodate.

No meat, poultry or seafood in the house. We are vegetarians. Thank you.","We are available to assist guests with any questions they may have and are very friendly, but respect our guests privacy.","Walking distance to movie theater, restaurants, Whole Foods grocery store, nature and hiking/biking trails.

"1. You‚Äôre living like a local, be respectful of the other locals. We mean, c‚Äômon, how would you feel if your neighbor wasn‚Äôt super awesome? 

2. All of our Rental Units are smoke-free environments. Even on the balcony, if you have one. We‚Äôre super sorry if this is a bummer, but it‚Äôs our policy. Hopefully we told you about it ahead of time and you aren‚Äôt super surprised that we still mean it. 

3. Pets are super awesome, but they aren‚Äôt allowed in our Rental Units. However, if your fur kiddo is a service animal then give us a call and we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your needs, as required by law.  

4. Your trip details should already be complete. If they aren‚Äôt, give us a call ASAP so we can rectify that! What‚Äôs a little information between friends?  

5. Your friend, your responsibility. Pretty simple, if you invite them to your Rental Unit, you‚Äôre responsible for their actions.  

6. While watching a million people get out of a clown car is hilarious, there are occupancy rules Stay Alfred must follow for each of our buildings. Help us follow the rules and check your rental contract for occupancy requirements. If you exceed it, don‚Äôt worry! Give us a call and we‚Äôll get you one of our bigger travel apartments. (It‚Äôs like needing an Uber XL when you have a ton of people with you!) 

7. We‚Äôre here to help! The onsite building staff doesn‚Äôt work for Stay Alfred‚Ä¶strange, right? So, if you need something, send us a chat, or just give us a call. Our awesome Guest Services department will assist you 24/7.

8. Take only memories, leave only the keys, fobs, parking passes, etc. behind. They won‚Äôt help you out when you get home and it‚Äôs a total pain to have to replace them. 

9. We love gifts, but the greatest gift is making sure you don‚Äôt leave anything behind. We suggest taking one last look around before you head home as fees are associated with sending you your belongings. Trust us, the extra five minutes is worth it! 

10. Ugh, here‚Äôs the hard one. Should you break anything, really mess something up, or decide to stay longer than your agreed upon length of stay, we have the right to charge you additional fees, but we‚Äôd really rather not (and, we‚Äôre sure you‚Äôd rather not too!)

11. Guests must be 21 years of age or older to make a Reservation, and the Guest who made the Reservation must be present for the duration of the stay. If the Guest who made the Reservation isn‚Äôt present during the stay, occupants may be removed from the Rental Unit, and the Reservation may be canceled without refund.",2 baths,2 beds,2 bedrooms,6

3. Pets are super awesome, but they aren‚Äôt allowed in our Rental Units. However, if your fur kiddo is a service animal then give us a call and we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your needs, as required by law.  

4. Your trip details should already be complete. If they aren‚Äôt, give us a call ASAP so we can rectify that! What‚Äôs a little information between friends?  

5. Your friend, your responsibility. Pretty simple, if you invite them to your Rental Unit, you‚Äôre responsible for their actions.  

6. While watching a million people get out of a clown car is hilarious, there are occupancy rules Stay Alfred must follow for each of our buildings. Help us follow the rules and check your rental contract for occupancy requirements. If you exceed it, don‚Äôt worry! Give us a call and we‚Äôll get you one of our bigger travel apartments. (It‚Äôs like needing an Uber XL when you have a ton of people with you!) 

7. We‚Äôre here to help! The onsite building staff doesn‚Äôt work for Stay Alfred‚Ä¶strange, right? So, if you need something, send us a chat, or just give us a call. Our awesome Guest Services department will assist you 24/7.

8. Take only memories, leave only the keys, fobs, parking passes, etc. behind. They won‚Äôt help you out when you get home and it‚Äôs a total pain to have to replace them. 

9. We love gifts, but the greatest gift is making sure you don‚Äôt leave anything behind. We suggest taking one last look around before you head home as fees are associated with sending you your belongings. Trust us, the extra five minutes is worth it! 

10. Ugh, here‚Äôs the hard one. Should you break anything, really mess something up, or decide to stay longer than your agreed upon length of stay, we have the right to charge you additional fees, but we‚Äôd really rather not (and, we‚Äôre sure you‚Äôd rather not too!)

11. Guests must be 21 years of age or older to make a Reservation, and the Guest who made the Reservation must be present for the duration of the stay. If the Guest who made the Reservation isn‚Äôt present during the stay, occupants may be removed from the Rental Unit, and the Reservation may be canceled without refund.","We believe in personal space. Prior to your arrival, your unit will be professionally cleaned and your self guided check in process ensures easy arrival with no long lines. Should you need us, we‚Äôre here 24/7 with our guest services team and local folks on the ground. And if you don‚Äôt need us, we‚Äôll stay out of your way. After all, this is your place in the city.","Chicago‚Äôs South Loop neighborhood is home to some of the city‚Äôs top things to do and places to eat - with a more laid-back atmosphere than the hustling, bustling Magnificent Mile. In this hip district, you‚Äôll find enormous, green parks like the Museum Campus and Northerly Island (not to mention Grant Park!) and streets that are a pedestrian‚Äôs dream with nice wide sidewalks. Cultural attractions abound, from the Field Museum to the Adler Planetarium to arts venues like the intimate M Lounge and storied Arie Crown Theater.","We furnish all of our properties to a uniform standard, but individual units may differ slightly from the pictures shown.","These stylish South Loop travel apartments are the perfect home base for any trip to Chicago, whether you‚Äôre coming to town on business or for a vacation with the fam.

The population of Wrigleyville/East Lakeview swells during beautiful summer afternoons and evening while the Cubs are at home (making the parking impossible and towing imminent). To avoid the crowds, walk the pleasant, pretty streets during away games. Try Clark Street for rows and rows AND rows of sports bars and airy patio dining and Southport Avenue for quieter date- and family-friendly establishments.  

Wrigleyville is adjacent to East Lakeview aka Boystown, home to a large and vibrant gay community, East Lakeview is brimming with great shopping and dining. The Chicago summer festival season piques in Boystown with the annual Pride Parade and the equally flamboyant Halsted Street Market Days. The neighborhood quiets down a bit in the beautiful gray- and brownstone-lined blocks south of Belmont.  East Lakeview's nightlife is unquestionably the most fun you'll have in the city. Dining options run the gauntlet from ultra chic to comfortably casual.

To the other side of Lakeview is the tan, fit, stroller-pushing set rule in Roscoe Village and West Lakeview.  The Southport Corridor rivals the boutique window-shopping streets of Lincoln Park and Wicker Park. The north side jewel is populated with gray- and brownstones, lush, tiny green lawns, funky boutiques, expensive grocery stores and cozy neighborhood restaurants.

Parking options: Avoid the outrageous parking fee for Cubs Games or concerts.  You can rent a PRIVATE PARKING space from the building management (ranging from $25-$45/day depending on Cubs games) where you will have a dedicated in/out spot during your stay for heavily discounted rates. Inquire within. Or choose to purchase STREET PARKING PERMITS.

You will find that my apartment is located walking distance from everything and everywhere you want to explore -- Lake Michigan, Boystown, Wrigley Field, Southport Corridor, and the famous mile of Wrigley Bars.  

The Red Line stations closest are Belmont and Addison.  The Brown line closest station is Southport.  

Lincoln Park is a short 15-20 minutes walk.  Downtown/The Loop is a short 15 minute train ride.  Within the city, Uber Pool / Lyft Line takes you anywhere in prices ranging from $3-8.

We're a stone's throw away from Starbucks and The Map Room. Located a few miles northwest of downtown, Bucktown has superb local fare and nightlife. Guests welcome regardless of orientation, religion, ethnicity, etc.

Our condo is homey and sprinkled with quirky, fun accents. Settle in and enjoy your stay‚Ä¶

Check-in is easy. A main building key is needed to enter and is the same for the front door, parking lot gate door and back building door. On the frontside of the building, locate the lock box hanging to the right of the front gate and enter the code provided before your arrival. Once inside, head to the second floor and find the purple door. To enter the apartment, use the keyless entry pad. Press the Schlage logo and then enter the code provided. 

During the day, the chaise couch is wonderful for relaxing and looking out the window. There‚Äôs a beautiful large tree that provides privacy and draws birds in for watching. Say hello to Morticia, our 13 y/o turtle. She lives in her hut and comes out to sunbathe midday, when her sun lamp turns on. 

Enjoy Apple TV with access to favorites like Netflix, Hulu, Bravo, HBO and Prime Video, or listen to any of our favorite vinyls. Other games & entertainment: Nintendo NES Classic, Nintendo Switch, PS4, adult coloring books, board games. Extra comfy blankets for napping in the basket under the sofa table. 

If cooking is your speed, there are gadgets and gear at your disposal. Dishwasher available for faster clean-up, and our favorite grocer is just 0.5 mile away. Feel free to use any spices, oils, vinegars in the cabinets. We are a coffee-loving house hold. Mugs and all the coffee essentials are above the coffee maker.

The bathroom was recently renovated and has some unique highlights. Reclaimed wood shelves, Dyson Supersonic hair dryer and adjustable shower head. The toilet paper holder is custom-made and slides in/out. Be gentle as it‚Äôs easy glide‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt need much force! Shower and bathroom supplies are on the tray in the guest room.

(Our smart lights, EcoBee and unit front door lock are controlled via Apple Home app. If you're an iPhone user and familiar with the Home app, we can offer access upon request.)

We understand some prefer to be left alone when traveling. So, feel comfortable asking for personal space, neighborhood tips or a pal with whom to grab a drink. We love this neighborhood as well as our home and are happy to be your local guides if requested!

If you research Bucktown, there are some seriously odd and taudry stories from times past. However, it's now regarded as one of the fun, quirky and bustling neighborhoods in West Town North area. Neighborhood architecture once focused on mid-rise buildings, but is now sprinkled with modern high rise build-ups. The neighborhood is highly walkable with fun bars, dining options of all kinds and great brunch spots. Holstein Park is a 5 minute walk north, and if you're into free live music, comedy and/or spoken word, check out a Chicago institution - Gallery Cabaret. If you like local neighborhood joints, grab a great cocktail at Charleston bar ... a few blocks up the street.

If driving, we're a 0.25 mile from the highway and street parking on our block is free. There is quick access to the Armitage and Fullerton 90/94 exits; other near exit includes the Damen 90/94-South ramp. If riding CTA, we're a 10 minute walk to the blue line and directly on the Armitage bus (73); other near bus routes are Damen (50) and Western (49). To get to the brown line, simply take the 73 bus east and get off at the stop in front of the Armitage station. If you're wanting a Divvy bike or public scooter, we are on the Armitage & Leavitt stop / zone.

Penguin Palace promotes healthy indoor air quality with purifiers in the living room and bedrooms. Humidifiers are also available for those with sleep and sinus issues - let us know upon booking and it will be ready to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Purifiers are all set on auto but feel free to adjust using the remote. 

More than likely, we will be here during your stay. During the work week, we cook dinner most nights and welcome you to join us if hungry. During the weekend, we tend to be lazy in the mornings before running errands or heading out.

FAQs
Q: Is the neighborhood safe?
A: Very much so. 24 hours a day.

Q: PARKING?
A: The home is very easy to get to via public transit. If you decide to drive, we recommend apps like SpotAngel or SpotHero to find free or cheap parking ($10-20 / night). 

Q: Do I need to bring towels, a hair dryer, or linens?
A: Nope! we provide all these things. Same with hotel-size toiletries (unless I happen to be out, which is rare).

Q: When can I check in or check out? 
A: Check in is 4pm and check out is 10am. Early check ins can be difficult if there are guests who checked out same day. We ask for an early check-in, or a late-check out fee, if you request either.

Q: Can I come and go as I please?
A: Yes. And we wouldn't trust any listing with which this isn't the case.

Q: Is the place professionally cleaned between guests?
A: Yes, and we take pride in providing a clean home for guests.

Q: What's my total booking price? 
A: We honestly have no idea. With fees included, it only shows the guest how much they pay. This figure should be present after you enter your dates. Note that, pricing varies on a daily basis, and it actually uses some crazy algorithm to adjust it automatically, so I don't actually control this.

Q: Are the beds comfortable?
A: Very. Some guests say they're the best they've ever slept on!

You have access to the home, balcony, full gym, and laundry facilities.

We're here to help as you need it! We give all of our guests full itinerary for their trip 2 days before their stay.

Printers Row is ‚Äúpocket‚Äù neighborhood just minutes from the Chicago Loop. After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the area became the Midwest hub of the printing industry with historically significant buildings designed by legendary architects like Daniel Burnham, William Holabird and William Le Baron Jenney. Today, many of those historic buildings remain but the quiet, tree lined streets are now largely residential. Of course, it continues to be a draw for fans of Chicago architecture.

During the day, the neighborhood is an easy walk to offices in the Loop, off Michigan Avenue, or in LaSalle Street financial centers. After hours, the district is alive with restaurants, boutiques, book and antique stores.

It boasts famous blues clubs, eclectic music venues and neighborhood taverns where residents gather. It also has an annual book fair: The Printers Row Book Fair gathers authors, poets, speakers and, of course, books.

Printer's Row is also walking distance to Chicago's Museum Campus, with the Field Museum, Adler Planetarium and Shedd Aquarium, and the newly redesigned Soldier Field.

With a 97 walk score and 100 transit score, you can get everywhere your heart desires in Chicago. The Red Line subway is one of the main subways in Chicago, and is only a block away. Many restaurants, shopping, parks, and museums are within walking distance.

Marshall Square, adjacent to the better known Pilsen area, was settled and built largely by Czechs in the later part of the 19th  and early 20th century. Buildings are almost exclusively brick with attractive facades and are separated by narrow ""gangways"". While not one of Chicago's trendier areas, transportation links into the Loop are excellent, with a train station at the end of the block and less than a 20 minute ride to the Loop. The neighborhood is predominately Mexican now, with many excellent and inexpensive restaurants. Laguinitas Brewery and Pub is just a few blocks away as is Cinespace Movie Studio, where several network and cable tv shows are filmed.

The apartment is located less than a block from the California Pink Line elevated stop which is 20 minutes from the Loop. There are two grocery stores, a Walmart, a Planet Fitness, three laundromats and many restaurants within a short walking distance from the building.

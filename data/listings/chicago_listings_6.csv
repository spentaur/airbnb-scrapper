https://airbnb.com/h/penthouse804

To access the building, we give you a simple code to go in-and-out as you please. You walk up the stairs to the elevators, and take the elevator to the top floor, the 8th floor.

When you exit the elevator, you turn right and then left down the hallway to your homes. 
When you enter each home, they open to an open, spacious loft. There is a dining area, a kitchen, a living room, a half bathroom,and private patio for those staying on the first level. 

There are 3 private patios for your access.

If you walk up to the 2nd floor, you will find a spacious loft with two full size beds, a huge closet,  and a full bathroom. This is truly a special place, and we look forward to making your stay a 5-star experience!

Q: Is the neighborhood safe?
A: Very much so. 24 hours a day.

Q: PARKING?
A: The home is very easy to get to via public transit. If you decide to drive, we recommend apps like SpotAngel or SpotHero to find free or cheap parking ($10-20 / night). 

Q: Do I need to bring towels, a hair dryer, or linens?
A: Nope! we provide all these things. Same with hotel-size toiletries (unless I happen to be out, which is rare).

Q: When can I check in or check out? 
A: Check in is 4pm and check out is 10am. Early check ins can be difficult if there are guests who checked out same day. We ask for an early check-in, or a late-check out fee, if you request either.

Q: Can I come and go as I please?
A: Yes. And we wouldn't trust any listing with which this isn't the case.

Q: Is the place professionally cleaned between guests?
A: Yes, and we take pride in providing a clean home for guests.

Q: What's my total booking price? 
A: We honestly have no idea. With fees included, it only shows the guest how much they pay. This figure should be present after you enter your dates. Note that, pricing varies on a daily basis, and it actually uses some crazy algorithm to adjust it automatically, so I don't actually control this.

Q: Are the beds comfortable?
A: Very. Some guests say they're the best they've ever slept on!

Q: Is this all one unit? 
A: No. Just to be clear these are four separate units that are all right next to each other in an exclusive area on the top floor.

You have access to all 4 suites, the gym, the patios, and the laundry in the lower level.

We're here to help as you need it! We give all of our guests full itinerary for their trip 2 days before their stay.

Printers Row is ‚Äúpocket‚Äù neighborhood  just minutes from the Chicago Loop. After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the area became the Midwest hub of the printing industry with historically significant buildings designed by legendary architects like Daniel Burnham, William Holabird and William Le Baron Jenney. Today, many of those historic buildings remain but the quiet, tree lined streets are now largely residential. Of course, it continues to be a draw for fans of Chicago architecture.

During the day, the neighborhood is an easy walk to offices in the Loop, off Michigan Avenue, or in LaSalle Street financial centers. After hours, the district is alive with restaurants, boutiques, book and antique stores.

It boasts famous blues clubs, eclectic music venues and neighborhood taverns where residents gather. It also has an annual book fair: The Printers Row Book Fair gathers authors, poets, speakers and, of course, books.

Printer's Row is also walking distance to Chicago's Museum Campus, with the Field Museum, Adler Planetarium and Shedd Aquarium, and the newly redesigned Soldier Field.

With a 97 walk score and 100 transit score, you can get everywhere your heart desires in Chicago. The Red Line subway is one of the main subways in Chicago, and is only a block away. Many restaurants, shopping, parks, and museums are within walking distance.

Humboldt Park is an emerging Chicago neighborhood on the near west side.  It's close enough to Wicker Park, Bucktown, and Logan Square that you can easily get to these neighborhoods by bus or lyft/uber but far enough away that it's quiet when you want it to be.  

The park is BEAUTIFUL and offers swimming, fishing, tennis, baseball, and soccer. 

We are also a 5-minute walk to the 606 bike/walk path that enters on either Drake or Lawndale.  This bike path will take you to the Wicker Park, south Logan Square, and Bucktown neighborhoods.

We are right by the North Ave  (72) bus that will take you to the Blue L line in 15 minutes and the Red L line in a half hour. Also a short distance from the Chicago (66) bus that will take you to the Red L line.  Lyft/Uber are your best bets in our neighborhood because we are a little ways from city action.

My husband, Dave, is a local Chicago chef and is available for a private tasting menu at our house if you'd like to book that with your stay (not included in Airbnb fees).","Smoking outside, please.

There are often guests socializing with other guests or the staff in the communal areas on the first floor. Many guests enjoy using the living or dining rooms as a pseudo-cafe where they can drink coffee or tea and work on their laptops. We encourage our guests to interact and use the shared spaces as they would their own homes. However, no one will shame you for hanging out in your room. We want everyone to feel safe and comfortable.

The Greenleaf House has become a hub in the Glenwood Avenue Art District of Roger‚Äôs Park, where all flavors of creative artists have lived and collaborated for several decades. The Mile of Murals‚Äîa community-based public art initiative‚Äîbegins half a block from our front door. Within easy walking distance you will find a bustling nightlife, small theaters and music venues, several locally-owned eateries, and Loyola Park, which has a great playground and arguably the best sand beach in the city.

Here are a few links about our neighborhood:

The Greenleaf House is conveniently located near two major public trains‚Äîwe are one block from the El (CTA Red Line at Morse Avenue) and three blocks (5-8 minute walk) from the Roger‚Äôs Park Metra Station. There are several bus stops within walking distance, including express buses to downtown. It is also never difficult to hail a cab, and Uber/Lyft rides generally arrive in 1-5 minutes after placing a request. For your convenience, we have included links to public transit information below.

Make no mistake, East Garfield Park is definitely the inner city.  It's filled with beauty and grit! There is a ton of diversity, art and life.  Think SoHo in the 70's.  You can't walk to a coffee shop but you can catch an art opening, eat some real BB-Q, walk the park and actually say hello to a total stranger.  Not a common thing for a big city.

Isn't that one of the best parts of travel!?

5 minute walk to the Kedzie Green Line takes you downtown in 9 minutes.  We're about 35 minutes from either airport.

I'm working during the day on weekdays, and occasionally on weekends, but I'm usually around in the evenings.  I'm happy to answer any and all questions, give directions and suggestions of what to do in the city!

My 2 dogs are also very friendly and welcoming-a little scratch behind the ears and they're your new best friend:)

The Rogers Park area has been experiencing a lot of growth-from new housing to restaurants and shopping.  There are also a number of ""hole in the wall"" gems that have been in the area for a long time.  There's a little bit of everything in this area.

Also, if you're staying for an extended time, there is a grocery store within a few minutes walking distance, along with both a Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts on the way to the el station.

The beauty of living in the city is that it's so easy to get around with public transportation!  There is easy access to buses, the ""el"" subway system, metra, and there are also cabs readily available.  

Transportation to/from the airport and condo: Both airports have an el line stop inside the airport, and can be taken to within a couple blocks of the condo (Howard stop).  There is also a cab line at each airport.  They're more direct and faster, but also more expensive than the el.

This 2nd story, apartment features an eat in kitchen, a double and a single bedroom, and a front room that oozes Chicago history.

Perfect for a quick weekend getaway or an extended stay. A Walk Score of 97 means you won't need a car to experience the city. Easy access to Division Blue Line, nightlife, shopping & adventure.

Take a step back in time and into a curious home full of art, light and vintage Chicago in this classic workman's Victorian cottage. 

Enter through the landscaped courtyard at the back of the building and up the outdoor staircase. 

The eat in kitchen comes equipped with everything we think you'll need including a microwave, antique farmhouse sink, apartment sized stove, full size fridge, and cooking utensils. 

Separated from the kitchen by curtains  is the master bedroom. You'll get a great night's sleep with  a queen size bed with a Sterns and Foster mattress and high quality natural fiber bedding. You'll also enjoy the vintage vanity (hello gorgeous!)  and rack for your clothing. 

The front room has a plush leather couch, live plants, obscenely large smart TV with Netflix and Hulu, vintage turntable and records, and a quintessential Chicago neighborhood view. 

The bathroom could be in a historical museum exhibit. It was installed so long ago that every pipe is visible (con) but contains a big gold glitter clawfoot bathtub (pro). Consider it an experience. 

The second bedroom is lovingly referred to as ""The Cozy Room"" it contains one plush twin size daybed with a mountain of pillows, an antique dresser and a rad, mod lamp, and a cherub chandelier. Thats it, because that is all it can hold. This room is small, mighty and separated from the main living space with curtains. 

Have you ever wondered what buildings looked like in Wicker Park before they were torn down and new condos were erected? This is your chance to live it. The floors aren't level, the walls are made of plaster, the windows are older than your grandparents. In no way is this an ""All Mod Cons"" apartment, but it is chock full of character, history and love. 

As a antique and vintage dealer for nearly 3 decades, some of the art and furniture may change occasionally and I'll do my best to update the pictures accordingly. If there is a particular piece you're interested in, there is a fair shot of brining it home as a souvenir. If you ask nicely for a list of secret-awesome-thrift stores, you might get a tip.

You have exclusive to the entire second floor of the pink house.

My family lives on the property and you'll be able to see as little or as much of us as you'd like. The garden and yard is shared with 2 other units so there is a good chance you'll meet some neighbors as well!

The East Village neighborhood is packed with restaurants, bars, nightlife, independent shopping, and corporate necessities like Target, Walgreens and Starbucks.  All of these businesses are less than a 10 minute walk away. 

Its easy to take a quick stroll, and stop by Hoosier Mama Bakery, Forbidden Root Brewery, Yuzu Sushi, Do√±a Naty's Mexican Restaurant, and get a look at the famous Shit Fountain, without getting anywhere near that day's step goal.

Getting into the heart of bustling Wicker Park aka The Crotch, is a lovely walk away.

You are a 4 minute walk to the Chicago Ave bus which will take you down to Navy Pier, a 10 minute walk to the Division Street Blue Line Stop, and 2 minutes to the Ashland Bus.

I work full time so you might not see me much. If I am home in the evening I sometime watch tv, and the sound seems to travel very well. To be considerate to my guest I do not watch it past 10.

The neighborhood  is  quiet and residential yet close to all the fun and lively new entertainment in the city. It is on the north west end of Bucktown close to Logan Square and Wicker Park.

The blue line is a few blocks away, it gets you downtown in an few minutes and to O'Hare Airport in about 20 minutes.  The Fullerton bus is two blocks away and get to the the red line in a few minutes. Parking is non permitted and there is always street parking close by.

This opportunity is good for long term, students or work.","This is a quiet house, so if you are a noisy it will not be a good fit.

FAQs
Q: Is the neighborhood safe?
A: Very much so. 24 hours a day.

Q: PARKING?
A: Your reservation comes with one spot in the lot next door to the building. If a spot is not available when you arrive, you can use SpotAngels to find a temporary spot until a spot opens up for you :)

Q: Do I need to bring towels, a hair dryer, or linens?
A: Nope! we provide all these things. Same with hotel-size toiletries (unless I happen to be out, which is rare).

Q: When can I check in or check out? 
A: Check in is 4pm and check out is 10am. Early check ins can be difficult if there are guests who checked out same day. We ask for an early check-in, or a late-check out fee, if you request either.

Q: Can I come and go as I please?
A: Yes. And we wouldn't trust any listing with which this isn't the case.

Q: Is the place professionally cleaned between guests?
A: Yes, and we take pride in providing a clean home for guests.

Q: What's my total booking price? 
A: We honestly have no idea. With fees included, it only shows the guest how much they pay. This figure should be present after you enter your dates. Note that, pricing varies on a daily basis, and it actually uses some crazy algorithm to adjust it automatically, so I don't actually control this.

Q: Are the beds comfortable?
A: Very. Some guests say they're the best they've ever slept on!

Tucked on Chicago's North Side between North Center and Lakeview, the little pocket that is Roscoe Village is a collection of laid-back taverns, destination brunch restaurants and cozy cafes that all seem to have pretty sidewalk patios and friendly beer gardens during the warm weather months, and a sense of neighborly camraderie during the winter months. Dining ranges from traditional comfort food to Turkish, burgers to bakeries, Cuban to creamy custards ‚Äî all serving up casual hospitality.

The Addison Brown Line stop is about a half-mile / 7 minute walk due east - easily accessible on the 152/Addison bus, which has a stop heading east pretty much across the street! The 49/Wester bus is nearby too, so it's easy to get around here without a car. If you do bring a car, however, there's plenty of street parking in the neighborhood.

In addition to easy access to and from Wrigley Field, we're  also close to music venues like the Beat Kitchen, the Metro, and the Vic Theatre, and conveniently located near the Southport Corridor, including the Music Box Theatre. It's a 10 minute drive to DePaul, 12 minutes to Belmont Harbor and the beach, and 15 minutes to Lincoln Park Zoo. And, since we're just east of the up-and-coming Avondale neighborhood, you'll find plenty of innovative restaurants and bars.","PLEASE NOTE THAT WE CHARGE PER GUEST AFTER A SET NUMBER.

Walk Score 94! Huge private bedroom/bathroom suite in our very large Wicker Park condo. 14' high ceilings and queen sized bed, private bathroom, closet for storage. Wifi, Apple TV and the like provided. Located in the middle of Wicker Park's best attractions, bus/rail, and dining. 

We're a late-20s working professional couple with two awesome babies and a great condo in Chicago's best hood. We're always game for hosting new and great people and would very much like to hear from you!

Wicker Park is hands down the best place in Chicago for foodies, plus we've got great access to the cities many culinary attractions. Our next door neighbor is an Italian cafe frequently referred to as having 'one of Chicago's best patios'. The lakefront/Lincoln Park/Gold Coast/Mag Mile is 10-20 minutes by bus depending on the time and day you are going. Our house is an 8 minute walk from two blue line stops to get you to/from O'hare and Downtown quickly. If going to Midway add a transfer to the Orange line for about 50 minutes total on the train.

Private bed and bath, kitchen and dining area (we love group meals!), baby gear (stroller, toys, changing table, port-a-crib), your own set of keys to come and go as you please, AppleTV, outdoor patios, Laundry, car rental (Zipcar), bike share (Divvy), transit/CTA and plenty of street parking

Up to them, but we love hosting folks and often find time to share a meal and maybe a movie. Usually if we're doing events around town we'll invite guests or even just for coffee/drinks with friends. One lucky couple got to go sailing with us :O

They call Brooklyn the Wicker Park of the East :P - We love our hood, it's full of energy, great food, art, cafes bars and just minutes from downtown and the lakefront or any other great Chicago attraction (Wrigley field!)

There's a bus stop on the street in front of our house. We also have bike-share on our block (Divvy) and are about 7 mins walking to the Damen or Division CTA Blue Line stops which connect downtown and to the airports.","We don't have many 'rules' but I do provide a very detailed guide that explains getting to the house, entry, kitchen, cleanup, et cetera kinds of things you might like to know. Our only request is that you respect the quiet times for the babies and treat them as you would your own. Thanks!","Up to them, but we love hosting folks and often find time to share a meal and maybe a movie.

I know this city like the back of my hand. Feel free to ask for info.

Because the condo is adjacent to the University of Chicago campus, there is a youthful and lively air to the community. You are likely to see many students and professors walking through the neighborhood, as well as inside the restaurants and businesses of the area.

The best way to get around the immediate area is by car, but if you wish to venture into the bustling streets of the downtown area, public transportation is the best way to avoid traffic. The Metra Electric Line, which  takes you straight into the heart of downtown Chicago, has a station at the Midway Plaisance, next to the intersection of 59th Street and Harper Avenue.

Coffee, tea and assorted snacks. I.E. granola bars, trail mix and Belvita bars provided.

"Let's do this:

CHECK-IN: 3:00 pm, but it can be earlier depending on whether a guest was there that morning, how quickly I can get the unit cleaned, etc. If you need to drop off bags earlier in the day we're happy to store them.

CHECK-OUT: 12:00 pm. I'm flexible if no one is coming in later that day, but if I've got another guest coming at 3:00 I'm afraid I have to throw ya' out by noon. If you need to leave your luggage here because you have a late flight just let me know.

CANCELLATION: We're considered ""moderate"" on the Airbnb scale.

SMOKING: Not in the apartment, please. There is a sitting area and ashtray right outside the back door, or you can go on the front porch.

PETS: Not allowed, sorry. 

ACCOMMODATIONS: The beds comfortably sleep three people, but it's possible to squeeze a second person in The Library and an additional person on the futon in the living room. We account for 4 guests in the room rental price but would charge an extra $25 per night for guest #5. No more than five guests are allowed. If the futon will be needed please notify us ahead of time so we can have it made up as a bed for you.

VISITORS: Feel free to invite over a few friends or family, but in order to be respectful to our neighbors we can't allow loud parties. If you want to reserve the backyard for a small get-together in the warm months just run it by us first (but unfortunately no grill is available).",1 bath,3 beds,2 bedrooms,5 guests,9695421,Historic &

Convenient street parking--only cars with special permits can park on our block, and we provide you with those permits. We've lovingly preserved our 1907 greystone & look forward to hosting you in beautiful Chicago!

Coming to see HAMILTON? The Blue Line (1 block away) will whisk you to the same block as the CIBC Theatre. Ask us for details!

Our classic Chicago greystone lies on a quiet residential street, half a block off Logan Square proper. My partner Cory and I strive to keep our home clean and comfortable, and the decor is very much a reflection of our personalities and our years of living here. Vintage furniture and artwork combined with a host of amenities have long been enjoyed by visiting family and friends, and we hope to extend the same level of hospitality to our Airbnb guests. We'll always be nearby and are happy to assist in any way we can!

(Tip: The Airbnb Map only shows the approximate locations of properties, and their placement is wildly inaccurate. Don't trust the map! We're on Troy Street, half a block north of Logan Boulevard. Many of the properties that appear near us on the map are actually quite far away, so proceed with caution!)

You'll meet me at check-in, but after that the amount of interaction we have is entirely up to you. I'm more than happy to give recommendations or directions or even a brief history of the house itself, but if you don't ask I'll simply vanish. You can also text me anytime if you need concierge tips (i.e. ""I'm at Willis Tower, how do I get home?"").

We're situated on the same block as the world-famous Longman & Eagle--but on the quiet, residential side--which also puts us half a block from Logan Square itself. The Centennial Monument, the legendary Lula Cafe, The Logan Theatre, Lost Lake, the Logan Square Comfort Station, Billy Sunday, Fat Rice, the Logan Square Farmer's Market, Mi Tocaya Antojeria, Quiote, Revolution Brewing, the Chicago Diner (vegan), and countless other bars and restaurants are all within a half mile from our front door. Of course there are also coffee shops, book stores, arcades, and even a medical marijuana dispensary, but if you're looking for something special just ask and we'll steer you in the right direction!

Tip: The phrase ""Logan Square"" refers to both the square and to the enormous neighborhood surrounding it, which can be confusing. There are parts of Logan Square the Neighborhood that generally aren't as convenient for tourists, so don't assume that all rentals ""in Logan Square"" are comparable.

Another tip: Hosts on Airbnb have the option of either showing the exact location of their property on the map, or showing its ""approximate location"" in a large blueish circle that spans half the neighborhood. Be cautious of hosts choosing to use the blue circle as that may mean their location isn't very convenient. We've always proudly advertised our exact address--we even posted a satellite photo--because our block is second to none!

ON FOOT: Part of the reason we live here is because so many things are in easy walking distance. We provide a custom map showing some of our favorite nearby restaurants, bars and other necessities (pharmacy, theaters, bank, landmarks) and encourage you to go out exploring! It's a very safe area--the countless people walking dogs mean you're never alone--so don't hesitate to hoof it.

BY BIKE: Chicago has a network of Divvy bike rental kiosks blanketing the city, and our nearest location is one block away. The Divvy stations in the immediate area are also depicted on our homemade map.

BY TRAIN: We're less than a block from an underground Blue Line stop, which means easy access to the train but without all the noise. The Blue Line is the train that runs to O'Hare International Airport, so if you're flying in to O'Hare getting here is a very quick and easy ride. The Blue Line also runs to Wicker Park and then on into downtown.

BUS: There's a bus terminal for the CTA #56 (West Loop) and #76 (Lincoln Park) buses right above the entrance to the Blue Line stop, one block away.

CAB: There's a cab stand across the street from Longman & Eagle just around the corner, and of course Uber and Lyft are very popular here if you want them to come to your door.

CAR: If you drove to Chicago or have a rental car, we'll provide you with complimentary parking passes that will allow you to park on our street. Because the street is permit-only it makes parking near our home quite easy.

Have allergies or sensitivities? We primarily use unscented and sensitive skin-type detergents and cleansers, and a full list of the products we use on your floor is available upon request.

We do have two medium-sized dogs. If you meet them in the yard they are extremely friendly, but if you're not ""a dog person"" just let us know and we'll happily keep them at bay.

Noise is a complaint in a lot of negative Airbnb reviews, so to avoid any unpleasant surprises we want to address noise directly: In our home you will not hear the train (it's elevated in most of Chicago, but the Logan Square stop is underground) and sirens are few and far between. And while our dogs keep the building extremely safe and we keep them quiet while we have guests, you still might hear the dogs bark briefly when the front door opens or when someone rings the doorbell. One of the joys of dog ownership!

And this should come as no surprise, but you might also hear our footsteps. We have rugs blanketing the 2nd floor to muffle and do our best to tiptoe, but the reality is that it's an old building and you are likely going to hear the occasional steps and floorboard squeaks as you would in any first floor unit.","Let's do this:

CHECK-IN: 3:00 pm, but it can be earlier depending on whether a guest was there that morning, how quickly I can get the unit cleaned, etc. If you need to drop off bags earlier in the day we're happy to store them.

CHECK-OUT: 12:00 pm. I'm flexible if no one is coming in later that day, but if I've got another guest coming at 3:00 I'm afraid I have to throw ya' out by noon. If you need to leave your luggage here because you have a late flight just let me know.

CANCELLATION: We're considered ""moderate"" on the Airbnb scale.

SMOKING: Not in the apartment, please. There is a sitting area and ashtray right outside the back door, or you can go on the front porch.

PETS: Not allowed, sorry. 

ACCOMMODATIONS: The beds comfortably sleep three people, but it's possible to squeeze a second person in The Library and an additional person on the futon in the living room. We account for 4 guests in the room rental price but would charge an extra $25 per night for guest #5. No more than five guests are allowed. If the futon will be needed please notify us ahead of time so we can have it made up as a bed for you.

VISITORS: Feel free to invite over a few friends or family, but in order to be respectful to our neighbors we can't allow loud parties. If you want to reserve the backyard for a small get-together in the warm months just run it by us first (but unfortunately no grill is available).","You'll meet me at check-in, but after that the amount of interaction we have is entirely up to you. I'm more than happy to give recommendations or directions or even a brief history of the house itself, but if you don't ask I'll simply vanish. You can also text me anytime if you need concierge tips (i.e. ""I'm at Willis Tower, how do I get home?"").","We're situated on the same block as the world-famous Longman & Eagle--but on the quiet, residential side--which also puts us half a block from Logan Square itself.

My partner Cory and I strive to keep our home clean and comfortable, and the decor is very much a reflection of our personalities and our years of living here. Vintage furniture and artwork combined with a host of amenities have long been enjoyed by visiting family and friends, and we hope to extend the same level of hospitality to our Airbnb guests. We'll always be nearby and are happy to assist in any way we can!

(Tip: The Airbnb Map only shows the approximate locations of properties, and their placement is wildly inaccurate. Don't trust the map! We're on Troy Street, half a block north of Logan Boulevard. Many of the properties that appear near us on the map are actually quite far away, so proceed with caution!)","Situated mere feet from Logan Square itself and the (quiet) underground Logan Square Blue Line train stop for easy 24/7 downtown and O'Hare access. Convenient street parking--only cars with special permits can park on our block, and we provide you with those permits. We've lovingly preserved our 1907 greystone & look forward to hosting you in beautiful Chicago!

Coming to see HAMILTON? The Blue Line (1 block away) will whisk you to the same block as the CIBC Theatre.

-----------
PARKING
There's a parking lot across the street which you can book in advance on an app.  It doesn't get much easier than that in Chicago.  Street parking is hard to find and not recommended.
----------
CHECK-IN TIME 
Typically, guests may receive the keys and drop their bags in the apartment as early as 12PM (noon). The cleaners do need until 4PM to do their work. 
If you'd like to drop your bags early, we can usually accommodate you!
If you'd like to take a nap or shower right away, and the night before your stay isn't booked yet, let's discuss booking that night before! Then you could arrive as early as you'd like that day! 
----------
CHECK-OUT TIME
11AM is check-out. If you'll need a check-out after 11AM, and the night after your stay isn't booked yet, let's chat about booking that next night! Then you could leave as late as you'd like that day!
Unfortunately we *do not* have anywhere to hold bags after your stay - sorry!
----------
ROLLAWAY BED
The twin rollaway bed is prepared before every stay with fresh linens.
The bed is physically locked into the upright position to help make the bed super easy to move around, and placed in the closet. Simply roll it into place and open. Everything will be ready for you. 
----------
OCCUPANCY 
Upon booking, your reservation will have paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number whether visiting or sleeping,  you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first. 
We consider the maximum capacity of the apartment to be its sleeping capacity - five individuals. Anyone past five would not be permitted. 
Enjoy the city! Please don‚Äôt bring a party back..
----------
RATES
Rates and minimum stays change constantly - every night is different! 
The nightly rate may change based on number of guests, which is verified upon arrival. Please do your best to let me know how many guests will be staying in advance!
----------
The pictures you see have accurate furniture, appliances, finishes, square footage - really everything! The art and positioning of items *might* be slightly different. Please don‚Äôt be concerned!

Chinatown
Chicago‚Äôs Chinatown is one of the largest neighborhoods of its kind in the US. Located on the city‚Äôs near South Side, the vibrant and energetic culture is reflected in the area‚Äôs many specialty shops, cultural cuisine and signature landmarks, like Ping Tom Memorial Park and a Buddhist Temple.
The main drag of Wentworth Avenue is a dim sum drenched display of Chinese food perfection. Along this epic street, you will discover restaurants, distinctive boutique shopping and the Chinatown Gate, a beautifully ornamented entryway to the neighborhood.
Just north of the Wentworth Avenue District is Chinatown Square, the largest Chinese mall in the Midwest. Besides hosting top restaurants, like Ken Kee, Phoenix or Lao Sze Chuan, you will find an incredible collection of public art that includes zodiac-inspired animal sculptures and twin pagodas. The area's signature piece, an enormous tile mosaic created by celebrated artists Yan Dong and Zhou Ping, represents the accomplishments of Chinese people in America. Rather poetically, the mural embodies the neighborhood as a significant gift to Chicago.

We're conveniently located near the intersection of Cermak Road and Wentworth Ave. Public transportation (bus, train) are less than a block away. Major highways  (I-90/94, I-290, I-55) all converge in this area. For the foodies, this is the place to be with many restaurants within walking distance and close by the downtown and South Loop area. Conventioneers will be glad to know that McCormick Place is a 16 minute walk/6 minutes drive away. See below for more details.

Walking
Many of the city‚Äôs top attractions are a short walk or ride away from each other. Weather-permitting, walking is the best way to see the city and the hidden treasures of architecture and public art in the downtown area.
When planning your route, keep in mind that every 8 blocks equals 1 mile.

Chicago Public Transportation (CTA)
The buses and trains of the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) are a fast and cost-effective way to get into and around the city. Known as the ‚ÄúL‚Äù (though they may be elevated or underground) the trains are a fun way to see The Loop from a new vantage point.
CTA visitor passes offer the best value, with unlimited rides on all CTA trains and buses. A 1-day pass is $10, a 3-day pass is $20, and a 7-day pass is $28.
Passes are easy to use. They activate the first time you use them and are valid for the number of consecutive days purchased. Just dip your pass into the bus fare machine or the train station turnstile.
Check the CTA website for the latest fares, travel alerts, and trip planners.

Taxis
Taxis are abundant throughout most of Chicago so finding a cab is typically easy. Taxi rates depend on gas prices and number of passengers and can get a bit pricey but provide a fast and convenient way to get around the city, particularly beyond downtown.

Biking
If time and weather permit, consider renting a bike. Chicago‚Äôs lakefront boasts 26 uninterrupted miles of easy bike and walking trails.
Half-day rentals are available from Bike and Roll at Navy Pier and Millennium Park.


From the Airports

O‚ÄôHare International Airport: 
Chicago‚Äôs O‚ÄôHare is one of the world‚Äôs busiest airports. It‚Äôs about 15 miles northwest of the Loop in downtown Chicago. O‚ÄôHare has 5 terminals, all of which have information booths and multilingual employees to assist you.

Midway International Airport:
Although it‚Äôs smaller than O‚ÄôHare, Midway is closer to the Loop and services more discount airlines (but fewer airlines overall). If you‚Äôre looking for a good deal on plane tickets, check out flights to Midway.

Chicago‚Äôs Chinatown is one of the largest neighborhoods of its kind in the US. Located on the city‚Äôs near South Side, the vibrant and energetic culture is reflected in the area‚Äôs many specialty shops, cultural cuisine and signature landmarks, like Ping Tom Memorial Park and a Buddhist Temple.
The main drag of Wentworth Avenue is a dim sum drenched display of Chinese food perfection. Along this epic street, you will discover restaurants, distinctive boutique shopping and the Chinatown Gate, a beautifully ornamented entryway to the neighborhood.
Just north of the Wentworth Avenue District is Chinatown Square, the largest Chinese mall in the Midwest. Besides hosting top restaurants, like Ken Kee, Phoenix or Lao Sze Chuan, you will find an incredible collection of public art that includes zodiac-inspired animal sculptures and twin pagodas. The area's signature piece, an enormous tile mosaic created by celebrated artists Yan Dong and Zhou Ping, represents the accomplishments of Chinese people in America. Rather poetically, the mural embodies the neighborhood as a significant gift to Chicago.","‚Ä¢ Check-in time 3 PM or later

Walking
Many of the city‚Äôs top attractions are a short walk or ride away from each other. Weather-permitting, walking is the best way to see the city and the hidden treasures of architecture and public art in the downtown area.
When planning your route, keep in mind that every 8 blocks equals 1 mile.

Chicago Public Transportation (CTA)
The buses and trains of the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) are a fast and cost-effective way to get into and around the city. Known as the ‚ÄúL‚Äù (though they may be elevated or underground) the trains are a fun way to see The Loop from a new vantage point.
CTA visitor passes offer the best value, with unlimited rides on all CTA trains and buses. A 1-day pass is $10, a 3-day pass is $20, and a 7-day pass is $28.
Passes are easy to use. They activate the first time you use them and are valid for the number of consecutive days purchased. Just dip your pass into the bus fare machine or the train station turnstile.
Check the CTA website for the latest fares, travel alerts, and trip planners.

Taxis
Taxis are abundant throughout most of Chicago so finding a cab is typically easy. Taxi rates depend on gas prices and number of passengers and can get a bit pricey but provide a fast and convenient way to get around the city, particularly beyond downtown.

Biking
If time and weather permit, consider renting a bike. Chicago‚Äôs lakefront boasts 26 uninterrupted miles of easy bike and walking trails.
Half-day rentals are available from Bike and Roll at Navy Pier and Millennium Park.


From the Airports

O‚ÄôHare International Airport: 
Chicago‚Äôs O‚ÄôHare is one of the world‚Äôs busiest airports. It‚Äôs about 15 miles northwest of the Loop in downtown Chicago. O‚ÄôHare has 5 terminals, all of which have information booths and multilingual employees to assist you.

Midway International Airport:
Although it‚Äôs smaller than O‚ÄôHare, Midway is closer to the Loop and services more discount airlines (but fewer airlines overall).

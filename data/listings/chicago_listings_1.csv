The bathroom has a clawfoot tub with a shower. We will provide shampoo, conditioner, soap, and towels. A blow dryer is also available for use.

Our home is over 100 years old,  so if brand new is what you're looking for,  this isn't it. But it's a clean, private, and cozy space with character.

We live directly across from a great park that has a playground, tennis courts, and a running track. We have some tennis rackets that you're welcome to use if you choose to play. Please let us know if you'd like to borrow them!

Hello and thank you for viewing my listing. If you decide to book you will be renting my entire apartment. It is not shared space! I stay in a diverse neighborhood. If you have a problem with African Americans and Hispanics this is not the Airbnb for you. Additionally I love my neighborhood because the pink line train is 3 minutes away.  Downtown is 15-20 minutes by train. Uber to downtown is between 5 and 10 dollars. The people are kind and friendly plus Douglas park is 5 mins away walking distance .  My place is up to date with everything to have a short or long stay. Currently I’m getting estimates to update the kitchen but all the appliances are brand new. So you can make yourself a hot meal if you choose to. Last but not lease did I mention Douglas Park host the riot fest  and a ton of other events. So thanks for taking the time to view my page. See you soon!!!

I would suggest the train it is cheap and convenient. ride sharing is cool . I have free on street parking in front of my apartment.

Chicago is a major urban city and you should always take precautions when walking around the city. If you are walking at night, pay attention to your surroundings and be safe. If heading downtown at night or coming home late, take a Lyft and pay just a few dollars to quickly and safely get to and from the train station in a matter of minutes. These tips apply in every Chicago neighborhood, even downtown on Michigan Avenue.","Smoking is allowed outside. If you smoke on premises you would be fined

NOTES: 
(1) REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY (see below)
(2) The host typically would like to greet the guests in person, occasionally this may not be possible.  In the latter case, please contact the host for the procedure of ""Self Check-in"". 
(3) Let the host know if you plan to drive so the parking matter can be addressed if needed.

REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY
Guests choose a place to stay based what it serves them the best.  We would like to highlight a few items worth considering and invite you to book this place.
(a) We run a very efficient operation and have a very competitive room rate with high quality rooms and services;
(b) This house has an exceptional great location.  It is about 10 minutes to a Green Line Station by walking (hence very close to downtown Chicago) and has convenient access to west, north west, and south west of greater Chicagoland by car.
(c) Free parking is provided.  Parking can be very very expensive in any larger metropolitan, including downtown Chicago.  Therefore it is much more economical to park here and take the train to downtown Chicago. If you rent a room in or near downtown Chicago, you implicitly or explicitly spend a lot of money just on parking.
(d) The ""Occupancy Tax"" is about 11% here which is much less than 23% or higher (doubled) in Chicago. The occupancy tax is paid by the guests based on the sum of room rate and cleaning fee.  With this tax and parking cost in mind, it is much more economical (and without losing convenient access to downtown Chicago) to stay in a convenient suburbs rather than in Chicago or downtown Chicago. Since the ""Occupancy Tax"" is waived if you stay 31 days or longer, you can avoid this tax and save quite a bit of money if you plan your trip ahead and check with the host for room availability.

====== Other Information  ========
Cereal, waffles and coffee are provided by the host for the ARRIVAL day/night of the guests. A full service restaurant (Blue Max Cafe) is only a block north of the house (serves breakfast and lunch only). Various fast food and slow food restaurants are also very close.  A great oriental message service is just couple blocks south of the house (not too expensive, please get coupon from the host for one-time discount).

The house is the middle of Oak Park and Forest Park downtown (almost equal distance).  You have access to 24 hours super markets, and all sorts of other stores and entertainment in both downtown, plus big Chicago downtown of course. Come to stay in the house, and enjoy both the big Chicago, and friendly cute downtown in both Oak Park and Forest Park.",,,,,"NOTES:

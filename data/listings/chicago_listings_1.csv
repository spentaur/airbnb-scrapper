The bathroom has a clawfoot tub with a shower. We will provide shampoo, conditioner, soap, and towels. A blow dryer is also available for use.

We live directly across from a great park that has a playground, tennis courts, and a running track. We have some tennis rackets that you're welcome to use if you choose to play. Please let us know if you'd like to borrow them!

Hello and thank you for viewing my listing. If you decide to book you will be renting my entire apartment. It is not shared space! I stay in a diverse neighborhood. If you have a problem with African Americans and Hispanics this is not the Airbnb for you. Additionally I love my neighborhood because the pink line train is 3 minutes away.  Downtown is 15-20 minutes by train. Uber to downtown is between 5 and 10 dollars. The people are kind and friendly plus Douglas park is 5 mins away walking distance .  My place is up to date with everything to have a short or long stay. Currently I’m getting estimates to update the kitchen but all the appliances are brand new. So you can make yourself a hot meal if you choose to. Last but not lease did I mention Douglas Park host the riot fest  and a ton of other events. So thanks for taking the time to view my page. See you soon!!!

I would suggest the train it is cheap and convenient. ride sharing is cool . I have free on street parking in front of my apartment.

Chicago is a major urban city and you should always take precautions when walking around the city. If you are walking at night, pay attention to your surroundings and be safe. If heading downtown at night or coming home late, take a Lyft and pay just a few dollars to quickly and safely get to and from the train station in a matter of minutes. These tips apply in every Chicago neighborhood, even downtown on Michigan Avenue.","Smoking is allowed outside. If you smoke on premises you would be fined

NOTES: 
(1) REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY (see below)
(2) The host typically would like to greet the guests in person, occasionally this may not be possible.  In the latter case, please contact the host for the procedure of ""Self Check-in"". 
(3) Let the host know if you plan to drive so the parking matter can be addressed if needed.

REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY
Guests choose a place to stay based what it serves them the best.  We would like to highlight a few items worth considering and invite you to book this place.
(a) We run a very efficient operation and have a very competitive room rate with high quality rooms and services;
(b) This house has an exceptional great location.  It is about 10 minutes to a Green Line Station by walking (hence very close to downtown Chicago) and has convenient access to west, north west, and south west of greater Chicagoland by car.
(c) Free parking is provided.  Parking can be very very expensive in any larger metropolitan, including downtown Chicago.  Therefore it is much more economical to park here and take the train to downtown Chicago. If you rent a room in or near downtown Chicago, you implicitly or explicitly spend a lot of money just on parking.
(d) The ""Occupancy Tax"" is about 11% here which is much less than 23% or higher (doubled) in Chicago. The occupancy tax is paid by the guests based on the sum of room rate and cleaning fee.  With this tax and parking cost in mind, it is much more economical (and without losing convenient access to downtown Chicago) to stay in a convenient suburbs rather than in Chicago or downtown Chicago. Since the ""Occupancy Tax"" is waived if you stay 31 days or longer, you can avoid this tax and save quite a bit of money if you plan your trip ahead and check with the host for room availability.

====== Other Information  ========
Cereal, waffles and coffee are provided by the host for the ARRIVAL day/night of the guests. A full service restaurant (Blue Max Cafe) is only a block north of the house (serves breakfast and lunch only). Various fast food and slow food restaurants are also very close.  A great oriental message service is just couple blocks south of the house (not too expensive, please get coupon from the host for one-time discount).

The house is the middle of Oak Park and Forest Park downtown (almost equal distance).  You have access to 24 hours super markets, and all sorts of other stores and entertainment in both downtown, plus big Chicago downtown of course. Come to stay in the house, and enjoy both the big Chicago, and friendly cute downtown in both Oak Park and Forest Park.",,,,,"NOTES:

Joyce is an experienced superhost & co-host and she  lives just down the street. She will be available for any needs. She has lived her entire life in Chicago and is happy to assist with any travel questions.

We are located in a gentrifying city neighborhood bordering the trendy West Loop area. You can walk a few blocks east to the United Center ( Bulls & Blackhawks games & Concert Venue). There is also a large multinational Fresh Food Market a few minutes walk and typical fast food. Otherwise not much to walk to. But we are just a few miles away from all Chicago has to offer! 
While we do NOT have any trendy cafes  or boutique shops  within  walking distance, WE ARE ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE BUS STOP ( or inexpensive $5-$ 8 Uber ride) to award winning West Loop destination restaurants, bars and shopping. This is a spacious affordable alternative to pricey neighborhoods while being minutes away from all the action. 

If you are ok with not walking directly to Chicago attractions and your travel style allows for a gentrifying city neighborhood this is the space for you!  Also see ""Getting Around"" section of the listing for more information.

You can  use the ""United Center"" ( a few blocks east)  in google maps for a location reference. Exact address is provided after booking.

Walk to the United Center in 5 minutes. The #126 Jackson bus stop is across the street. Cost is $2.50 Sometimes it may be better to Uber or Lyft. Less than 10 minute ride to West Loop. 15 minutes to downtown Chicago Loop ( city center) and Michigan Ave the lakefront and museums.

Walk to the Food Market ( also liquor) store. 

FROM AIRPORTS TO THE CONDO 

O'Hare - about 35 minutes.

Follow signs for ""trains to city "". Take the BLUE Line train. Get off at the SECOND Western stop. Do NOT get off at the first Western stop.  Walk 4 blocks to the house. There is a map included in the listing pictures. '

Midway - About 35 minutes
Follow signs "" trains to city"" . Take ORANGE Line train and transfer to the BLUE line - FOREST PARK train. Get off at WESTERN stop. Walk 4 blocks to the house. There is a map included in the listing pictures.

Lovely single family house with a large fenced backyard. One nice cozy bedroom on the second floor. Common areas including breakfast room (in basement), kitchen, and laundry room. Has office amenities (Wifi, copier, iron, ...) and washer & dryer.

Quiet and nice southwest suburb.  The exact address is NOT in Oak Park, but south of Oak Park. It is located near Midway Airport, and can easily reach Chicago downtown and west suburbs through Ogden Avenue, and Harlem Avenue (which connect to Cermak, Roosevelt, and I-290). There is also a Metra Station at Harlem Avenue nearby (which is served by PACE 307 bus). Close to a major supermarkets and various stores.

***** NOTES *****
(1) REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY (see below)
(2) The host typically would like to greet the guests in person, occasionally this may not be possible.  In the latter case, please contact the host for the procedure of ""Self Check-in"".
(3) Each room has its own numeric lock (no charge) and the guest can set his/her own code. The lock is very secure. If you forget the code, the lock must be cut and destroyed.  The cost  for each lock is $11 when it must be destroyed.  Please leave the host your code and do not try to reset the lock (as you are likely to make a mistake and render the lock useless).
(4) Street parking (day and night) is available.

REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY
Guests choose a place to stay based what it serves them the best.  We would like to highlight a few items worth considering and invite you to book this place.
(a) We run a very efficient operation and have a very competitive room rate with high quality rooms and services;
(b) Free parking up to a month can be easily arranged.  Parking can be very very expensive in any larger metropolitan, including downtown Chicago.  Therefore it is much more economical to park here and take the train to downtown Chicago. If you rent a room in or near downtown Chicago, you implicitly or explicitly spend a lot of money just on parking.
(c) The ""Occupancy Tax"" is about 11% in this village which is much less than 23% or higher (doubled) in Chicago. The occupancy tax is paid by the guests based on the sum of room rate and cleaning fee.  With this tax and parking cost in mind, it is much more economical (and still without losing convenient access to downtown Chicago) to stay in a convenient suburbs rather than in Chicago or downtown Chicago. Since the ""Occupancy Tax"" is waived if you stay 31 days or longer, you can avoid this tax and save quite a bit of money if you plan your trip ahead and check with the host for room availability.",,,,,"Quiet and nice southwest suburb.

Late kitchen with table and large screen TV in the living room are available for use with HDML cable.

The room is not entirely private in that the wall to living room is half, with a thick curtain. This makes it visually private but not soundproof. It’s not the best choice for being raucous or requiring a completely soundproof space. However, we stay in the back of the apartment so you can stay up and talk as you wish and maintain your privacy. Open curtain allows a lovely view of the porch/outdoors, along with full living room access. It’s Very bright and airy, though the bedroom can be made pitch park with the curtain. 
The main lock is tricky. No need to mention it in reviews, please. You must put the key in all the way, pull it out slightly and turn to the right. 
We are handicapped accessible with no steps or stairs, and offer a bath grip bar.

Our garden-level condo has three bedrooms and two bathrooms - one of which is an ensuite in the master bedroom, with a luxurious standup shower - and a recently renovated kitchen with new appliances.

Lincoln Park is also home to five architecturally significant churches: St. Vincent de Paul Parish, St. Clement Church, St. Josaphat's (one of the many so-called 'Polish Cathedrals' in Chicago), St. James Lutheran Church and St. Michael's Church in the Old Town Triangle area of Lincoln Park. Visible from throughout the neighborhood, these monumental edifices tower over the neighborhood, lending the area much of its charm. Five Lincoln Park churches are affiliated with the Catholic Church (St. Bonaventure Oratory, Saint Clement Church, St. Michael in Old Town, St. Teresa de Avila Catholic Parish, St. Vincent de Paul Parish). The neighborhood also houses Children's Memorial Hospital (recently moved to Streeterville and was renamed Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago) and the currently closed Lincoln Park Hospital (formerly known as Grant Hospital and before that German-American Hospital), which is slated for redevelopment to condominiums, apartments, medical offices, and retail to be renamed Webster Square.

Chicago has an and easy to use public transportation system. The Chicago Transit Authority from both airports (ORD and MDW) to the city and buses and trains to every neighborhood. You can pay-as-you-go for about $2.25 one-way or pick up a CTA 1,3,7 or 30-day Ventra Transit Account Card and ride the buses and trains any distance as much as you want. The CTA website / APP can help with every aspect of travel plans while you're here on your vacation.

Chicago also has one of the largest bike rental programs, just under 5000 bikes at almost 500 neighborhood stations -- Divvy Bike Share Program. You can rent at one docking station and ride as long as you want and when you're finished, just drop off at a station nearest destination.

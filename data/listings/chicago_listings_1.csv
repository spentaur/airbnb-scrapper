The bathroom has a clawfoot tub with a shower. We will provide shampoo, conditioner, soap, and towels. A blow dryer is also available for use.

We live directly across from a great park that has a playground, tennis courts, and a running track. We have some tennis rackets that you're welcome to use if you choose to play. Please let us know if you'd like to borrow them!

Hello and thank you for viewing my listing. If you decide to book you will be renting my entire apartment. It is not shared space! I stay in a diverse neighborhood. If you have a problem with African Americans and Hispanics this is not the Airbnb for you. Additionally I love my neighborhood because the pink line train is 3 minutes away.  Downtown is 15-20 minutes by train. Uber to downtown is between 5 and 10 dollars. The people are kind and friendly plus Douglas park is 5 mins away walking distance .  My place is up to date with everything to have a short or long stay. Currently I’m getting estimates to update the kitchen but all the appliances are brand new. So you can make yourself a hot meal if you choose to. Last but not lease did I mention Douglas Park host the riot fest  and a ton of other events. So thanks for taking the time to view my page. See you soon!!!

I would suggest the train it is cheap and convenient. ride sharing is cool . I have free on street parking in front of my apartment.

Chicago is a major urban city and you should always take precautions when walking around the city. If you are walking at night, pay attention to your surroundings and be safe. If heading downtown at night or coming home late, take a Lyft and pay just a few dollars to quickly and safely get to and from the train station in a matter of minutes. These tips apply in every Chicago neighborhood, even downtown on Michigan Avenue.","Smoking is allowed outside. If you smoke on premises you would be fined

NOTES: 
(1) REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY (see below)
(2) The host typically would like to greet the guests in person, occasionally this may not be possible.  In the latter case, please contact the host for the procedure of ""Self Check-in"". 
(3) Let the host know if you plan to drive so the parking matter can be addressed if needed.

REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY
Guests choose a place to stay based what it serves them the best.  We would like to highlight a few items worth considering and invite you to book this place.
(a) We run a very efficient operation and have a very competitive room rate with high quality rooms and services;
(b) This house has an exceptional great location.  It is about 10 minutes to a Green Line Station by walking (hence very close to downtown Chicago) and has convenient access to west, north west, and south west of greater Chicagoland by car.
(c) Free parking is provided.  Parking can be very very expensive in any larger metropolitan, including downtown Chicago.  Therefore it is much more economical to park here and take the train to downtown Chicago. If you rent a room in or near downtown Chicago, you implicitly or explicitly spend a lot of money just on parking.
(d) The ""Occupancy Tax"" is about 11% here which is much less than 23% or higher (doubled) in Chicago. The occupancy tax is paid by the guests based on the sum of room rate and cleaning fee.  With this tax and parking cost in mind, it is much more economical (and without losing convenient access to downtown Chicago) to stay in a convenient suburbs rather than in Chicago or downtown Chicago. Since the ""Occupancy Tax"" is waived if you stay 31 days or longer, you can avoid this tax and save quite a bit of money if you plan your trip ahead and check with the host for room availability.

====== Other Information  ========
Cereal, waffles and coffee are provided by the host for the ARRIVAL day/night of the guests. A full service restaurant (Blue Max Cafe) is only a block north of the house (serves breakfast and lunch only). Various fast food and slow food restaurants are also very close.  A great oriental message service is just couple blocks south of the house (not too expensive, please get coupon from the host for one-time discount).

The house is the middle of Oak Park and Forest Park downtown (almost equal distance).  You have access to 24 hours super markets, and all sorts of other stores and entertainment in both downtown, plus big Chicago downtown of course. Come to stay in the house, and enjoy both the big Chicago, and friendly cute downtown in both Oak Park and Forest Park.",,,,,"NOTES:

Joyce is an experienced superhost & co-host and she  lives just down the street. She will be available for any needs. She has lived her entire life in Chicago and is happy to assist with any travel questions.

We are located in a gentrifying city neighborhood bordering the trendy West Loop area. You can walk a few blocks east to the United Center ( Bulls & Blackhawks games & Concert Venue). There is also a large multinational Fresh Food Market a few minutes walk and typical fast food. Otherwise not much to walk to. But we are just a few miles away from all Chicago has to offer! 
While we do NOT have any trendy cafes  or boutique shops  within  walking distance, WE ARE ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE BUS STOP ( or inexpensive $5-$ 8 Uber ride) to award winning West Loop destination restaurants, bars and shopping. This is a spacious affordable alternative to pricey neighborhoods while being minutes away from all the action. 

If you are ok with not walking directly to Chicago attractions and your travel style allows for a gentrifying city neighborhood this is the space for you!  Also see ""Getting Around"" section of the listing for more information.

You can  use the ""United Center"" ( a few blocks east)  in google maps for a location reference. Exact address is provided after booking.

Walk to the United Center in 5 minutes. The #126 Jackson bus stop is across the street. Cost is $2.50 Sometimes it may be better to Uber or Lyft. Less than 10 minute ride to West Loop. 15 minutes to downtown Chicago Loop ( city center) and Michigan Ave the lakefront and museums.

Walk to the Food Market ( also liquor) store. 

FROM AIRPORTS TO THE CONDO 

O'Hare - about 35 minutes.

Follow signs for ""trains to city "". Take the BLUE Line train. Get off at the SECOND Western stop. Do NOT get off at the first Western stop.  Walk 4 blocks to the house. There is a map included in the listing pictures. '

Midway - About 35 minutes
Follow signs "" trains to city"" . Take ORANGE Line train and transfer to the BLUE line - FOREST PARK train. Get off at WESTERN stop. Walk 4 blocks to the house. There is a map included in the listing pictures.

Lovely single family house with a large fenced backyard. One nice cozy bedroom on the second floor. Common areas including breakfast room (in basement), kitchen, and laundry room. Has office amenities (Wifi, copier, iron, ...) and washer & dryer.

Quiet and nice southwest suburb.  The exact address is NOT in Oak Park, but south of Oak Park. It is located near Midway Airport, and can easily reach Chicago downtown and west suburbs through Ogden Avenue, and Harlem Avenue (which connect to Cermak, Roosevelt, and I-290). There is also a Metra Station at Harlem Avenue nearby (which is served by PACE 307 bus). Close to a major supermarkets and various stores.

***** NOTES *****
(1) REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY (see below)
(2) The host typically would like to greet the guests in person, occasionally this may not be possible.  In the latter case, please contact the host for the procedure of ""Self Check-in"".
(3) Each room has its own numeric lock (no charge) and the guest can set his/her own code. The lock is very secure. If you forget the code, the lock must be cut and destroyed.  The cost  for each lock is $11 when it must be destroyed.  Please leave the host your code and do not try to reset the lock (as you are likely to make a mistake and render the lock useless).
(4) Street parking (day and night) is available.

REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY
Guests choose a place to stay based what it serves them the best.  We would like to highlight a few items worth considering and invite you to book this place.
(a) We run a very efficient operation and have a very competitive room rate with high quality rooms and services;
(b) Free parking up to a month can be easily arranged.  Parking can be very very expensive in any larger metropolitan, including downtown Chicago.  Therefore it is much more economical to park here and take the train to downtown Chicago. If you rent a room in or near downtown Chicago, you implicitly or explicitly spend a lot of money just on parking.
(c) The ""Occupancy Tax"" is about 11% in this village which is much less than 23% or higher (doubled) in Chicago. The occupancy tax is paid by the guests based on the sum of room rate and cleaning fee.  With this tax and parking cost in mind, it is much more economical (and still without losing convenient access to downtown Chicago) to stay in a convenient suburbs rather than in Chicago or downtown Chicago. Since the ""Occupancy Tax"" is waived if you stay 31 days or longer, you can avoid this tax and save quite a bit of money if you plan your trip ahead and check with the host for room availability.",,,,,"Quiet and nice southwest suburb.

Late kitchen with table and large screen TV in the living room are available for use with HDML cable.

The room is not entirely private in that the wall to living room is half, with a thick curtain. This makes it visually private but not soundproof. It’s not the best choice for being raucous or requiring a completely soundproof space. However, we stay in the back of the apartment so you can stay up and talk as you wish and maintain your privacy. Open curtain allows a lovely view of the porch/outdoors, along with full living room access. It’s Very bright and airy, though the bedroom can be made pitch park with the curtain. 
The main lock is tricky. No need to mention it in reviews, please. You must put the key in all the way, pull it out slightly and turn to the right. 
We are handicapped accessible with no steps or stairs, and offer a bath grip bar.

We're also right around the corner from Lottie's Pub, made famous by Chicago Fire, and you'll love Bucktown's charm and how easy it is to get to the Loop from here - book today!

Our garden-level condo has three bedrooms and two bathrooms - one of which is an ensuite in the master bedroom, with a luxurious standup shower - and a recently renovated kitchen with new appliances. There's a dining room with seating for 6, and our living room has a cushy L-shaped couch and wall-mounted TV.

We're a 10 minute walk to the Damen blue line station, and just steps to the Damen and Armitage buses - you won't have any trouble getting around town without a car from here! If you do bring your car, however, there's plenty of street parking in the neighborhood.","Very simply, please respect my home and my neighbors.

Lincoln Park is also home to five architecturally significant churches: St. Vincent de Paul Parish, St. Clement Church, St. Josaphat's (one of the many so-called 'Polish Cathedrals' in Chicago), St. James Lutheran Church and St. Michael's Church in the Old Town Triangle area of Lincoln Park. Visible from throughout the neighborhood, these monumental edifices tower over the neighborhood, lending the area much of its charm. Five Lincoln Park churches are affiliated with the Catholic Church (St. Bonaventure Oratory, Saint Clement Church, St. Michael in Old Town, St. Teresa de Avila Catholic Parish, St. Vincent de Paul Parish). The neighborhood also houses Children's Memorial Hospital (recently moved to Streeterville and was renamed Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago) and the currently closed Lincoln Park Hospital (formerly known as Grant Hospital and before that German-American Hospital), which is slated for redevelopment to condominiums, apartments, medical offices, and retail to be renamed Webster Square.

Bronzeville is a magnet for young urban professionals and  entrepreneurs who are leading the revitalization of the area and the restoration of its historic landmarks. The history of the area has made it something of a tourist attraction, and the neighborhood has many new businesses, including cafes, coffeehouses, and quaint shops. The demographic trends young, but there are many families with children in this tight-knit community.

Bronzeville is convenient to the city’s business district with easy access to anywhere in town, with plenty of public transportation options. The Chicago Transit Authority operates the Red and Green rail lines which serve the Bronzeville neighborhood, as does the Metra Electric District Main Line. Several bus routes run through the area, and the major artery of the Dan Ryan Expressway is just a few minutes’ drive away.

•Take your shoes off at the door

•Failure to return the keys will result in a $250 lost key charge

If you need it, it’s a 20minute drive to downtown. Comfortable, calm and convenient. We love to go that extra mile, so you feel like you are at home.

Without a doubt, this place makes for a true “revival” for those in need of one. We are sure you will enjoy this home as much as we do.

We’ll supply you with:
- Ultra comfortable bed Linen
- Towels
- Bathrobes
- Toiletries

We guarantee a private stay. The bathroom is shared with three other rooms. Upon your arrival, we will stock up the fridge with fresh milk, yogurts, cereals, drinks and some other healthy and extremely tasteful essentials. To make sure you have the basics without having to leave home to get them.

We have provided teas, coffee, and snacks, so all that’s left for you to do is relax and settle in after your journey. Or if you prefer, you can enjoy a refreshing shower; we have stocked the bathroom with gentle toiletries.

"House Rules:

All bookings require a security deposit of $500 or more. This deposit will not be charged in advance.  

Kindly note that the special reduction in Cleaning Fees is only for the Winter Season hence the regular Cleaning fees of USD 125 will be applicable for all arrivals on or after 01 March, 2019 on wards.  

For security purposes, we require all guests to provide an ID verification, license, or passport before check-in.  

Guests can cancel within 24 hours of booking and receive a full refund, or cancel anytime up to seven days before the start of your trip and receive a 50% refund. Trips cancelled fewer than seven days in advance are not eligible for refunds.

For live music and nightlife, sit back for some jazz at the Green Mill, a 100-year-old classic where the swanky atmosphere harkens back to prohibition's heyday. Or for a lively mix, go for either indie rock, salsa concerts, world-class boxing or colorful wrestling matches at the Riviera or Aragon.

More information
Historical landmarks districts in Uptown Square are just some of the architectural highlights. Immerse yourself in the present while experiencing history, just have a sample of the ethnic cuisines that have found a home in the neighborhood. On Argyle Street and the surrounding blocks, you can take a tour of Asia with destination restaurants serving up Beijing duck, sushi, traditional Chinese dim sum and Vietnamese specialties like banh mi and pho. Adding to the variety are ethnic grocers mixed among Ethiopian, Lebanese, Indian cuisine and SO much more.

Whether you got a set a wheels, using public transportation or you're just old fashioned walking, the neighborhood works for any transportation needs.

There is easily accessible ""Pay to Park"" street parking. Additionally, there is loads of public transportation! Just a few blocks from the red line for getting in and out of the loop/downtown. There are also buses on every street corner.

The neighborhood is all completely walkable for anything you can possibly need on the fly.

Hip Wicker Park has been a residential enclave since Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837.

Mi esposo habla español. One of us is usually home and we're available to provide any guidance you need. We also understand that this is your time and you may not want to spend it socializing, so feel free to just say hi and bye. My husband has lived in Pilsen for 40 years and I've been here 15 years, so we know all the spots - feel free to ask for a recommendation!

We're an activist family and care deeply about accommodating all backgrounds - race & ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, religious or nonreligious identity, age, urban/rural, immigration status - all are welcome and respected

Pilsen is our favorite neighborhood in Chicago and is in the midst of dramatic change - hopefully change that retains the vibrant Mexican culture that makes it what it is. This is an artistic and culinary mecca for Chicago, with galleries throughout the neighborhood, politically and socially conscious murals on every block, and a wide array of food, including some of Chicago's best Mexican cuisine. The Mexican Fine Arts Museum is one of the best in the country. Several breweries are located here, along with dive bars, comedy spots, upscale fusion restaurants and music and mole festivals throughout the warm months. This is a demographically diverse community that is still dominated by Mexican families, but has a strong hipster and young professional presence as well. Get ready for Portlandia style beards and coiffed dogs.

Public transit is very convenient - you can hop the 18th street bus a half block away, the #60 Blue Island bus to downtown just 2 blocks away, or the Pink Line El train to anywhere just 2 1/2 blocks away. Get to Chinatown by hopping the #22 bus on Cermak and Ashland - you’ll be there for wontons and Chinese dumplings in 10 min. 

There is permit parking on the street and we're happy to provide you a permit for your time with us for $2/day ($3/day starting Feb 1).

We have two sweet cats, one of whom is very shy and will probably disappear when you're around. The other likes to be petted. They will be kept out of your room unless you want them around.

Pre-check in baggage drop off welcomed. In case you need to drop your bags off before check in, please let us know and we will gladly accommodate you.",,"Mi esposo habla español.

We are Elma and Edo, originally from former Yugoslavia (Bosnia-Hercegovina), and we have made Chicago home for the last 20 years. We are empty nesters spending our time busy with work, but also enjoying visiting parks and Nature preserves, biking, picnics and summer bbqs. Our children are currently off seeing the world. We love meeting new people and we would help with any questions about getting around the city or any recommendations on places to see and visit. We both work full time and are usually around most evenings.

We love our neighborhood! It is a diverse, immigrant friendly neighborhood, very family oriented with tons of authentic ethnic food available. Easy access to Japanese, Korean, Indian, Iranian, Mexican and Mediterranean cuisine. Devon Ave is a wonderful experience of Chicago's ""Little India"" with family owned shops, restaurants and dessert cafes! A very authentic Chicago North side experience!

Near Western Avenue, a 5 minute walk to 49 B Western Bus, you can take south toward Western CTA Brown Line Station, located in Lincoln Square, a charming historic neighborhood, and the 84 W Peterson Bus, you can take east toward CTA Bryn Mawr Red Line Station or the beach in the Edgewater neighborhood. Take 155 W Devon Bus east toward Loyola University and the CTA Loyola Red Line stop, or continue onto to another bus that goes to Downtown via Lake Shore Drive. 
A 20 minute drive to I 94, or to Lake Shore Drive. Heading south on Western Ave is also a convenient way to visit other Chicago neighborhoods heading south, or pay a visit to Evanston IL, about a 25 minute drive north of Roger's Park.

Wicker Park and Bucktown are one of Chicago's creative epicenters and they lie just outside of downtown. These synonymous neighborhoods are famous for live music, nightlife, chef-driven restaurants and countless art galleries — many housed within the Flat Iron Arts Building. If you have an acute knowledge of craft cocktails, an affinity for coffee, enjoy sifting through records or thrifted threads, there's no better area than Bucktown and Wicker Park!

The area has become a prevailing influence on Chicago's Michelin-rated, James Beard Award-winning dining scene, and boasts some of the city's most sought after tables. Wicker Park and Bucktown are also known for their palate pleasing nightcaps, like renowned brewery Piece and mixology tour de force The Violet Hour.

Along North, Division, Milwaukee and Damen Avenues you will find an unbelievable blend of vintage shops and independently-owned boutiques touting fashions for both men and women, and luxury home goods and beauty products. On the same blocks are nationally-recognized names in fashion, and a mix of national and global retail chains that make this one of the best places to shop in Chicago!

This apartment has a great location and you are a 10-15 minute walk from most of the attractions in the neighborhood. If you want to venture beyond Wicker Park and Bucktown the most convenient way is the train. The Western stop on the Blue Line train is 0.8 miles (about a 15 minute walk) from the apartment. The Blue Line runs from O'Hare International Airport to downtown. There are also plenty of Uber/Lyfts and taxis if needed!

This apartment does not have parking, but we recommend using parking apps like SpotHero to help you find street parking.","PLEASE NOTE THAT WE CHARGE PER GUEST AFTER A SET NUMBER.

Situated on the Des Plaines River, Des Plaines is an outdoor lover's paradise.

Autumn is a particularly wonderful time on the river, as the leaves glow in fiery shades of red, orange and yellow.

For those ""walking score"" crowd, one of the hidden gems of our neighborhood is ""Mansion Row"" which actual encompasses several blocks of the largest, most opulent mansions in all of Chicago including the most expensive home in Chicago (asking price of $50M.  Address: 1932 N Burling).  I live in the neighborhood (but not in one of the mansions. ha!) and one of my favorite year-round activities is strolling up and down streets like Burling, Orchard, Howe just enjoying the beautiful homes.  And from there you can keep walking East to Lincoln Park which, at 1208 acres, is more than a one-day walking activity!  I also encourage walkers to head just a few blocks South to Old Town which is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Chicago full of Victorian-era buildings, quaint brick-paved streets and little eateries.

Super Cool Loft Photo Studio located in the urban vibe of West Town! This room was recently renovated to create a clean, mod space for the hip traveler.  Just blocks from everything:
Downtown,Wicker Park/Bucktown,Randolph St.,United Center + free parking
This space is amazing with 3 enormous open concept levels to call your own.  We wanted to create a place that is really clean with great comforts, cable, Internet, and an overall chill factor.  This room can accommodate an individual or two guests traveling together.   This is not a shared space.    When you book, you and your guest will be the only people occupying the space!  By day, we are a cutting edge photo studio and by night, a chic space you can call your own in the heart of Chicago's industrial corridor.

Besides the guestroom located on the third floor with a great view of United Center, please make yourself comfortable in our beautiful modern kitchen -- oven, stove, dishwasher, refrigerator, tableware.... all the amenities for any meal on the second floor with a private deck with seating for 4 should you want to eat, drink or hang out.   We also have an awesome office on the first floor,   where can easily spread out in this large workspace.

We will be available the entire length of the guest's stay.  We live next door if you need anything at all, we would be delighted to help. :)

West Town is a HOT neighborhood located in the industrial corridor minutes from Bucktown, Wicker Park, United Center, the Loop, Randolph Street, and Ukrainian Village.  There's tons of free street parking in front of the studio. 
Ukrainian Village voted #1 Hottest Neighborhood 2016 in the US by Redfin!!!

Super easy to access anywhere you want to go!  O'Hare? Midway?  Simple! The CTA 65 Grand Bus is a 2 minute walk out the door which can take you to the Blue Line (O'Hare Airport) or downtown or the CTA 50 is also a 5 minute walk out the door which can take you to the Orange Line (Midway Airport).  Cabs are always plentiful and we are located a quick cab ride away.

Hey There Smokers --- although there is NO SMOKING in the studio/loft, there is an awesome deck outside off the kitchen with an ashtray waiting for you!  Outside on the deck is the designated smoking area, this is the ONLY area we allow smoking.
No kids and no pets :)  While both are adorable and we just love them, we are neither a kid friendly or pet friendly space.  If you sneak them in you will be asked to leave immediately...really.","Feel free to ""pop"" on any of the many backdrops for a ""selfie"" as part of the fun of staying in this 3000 sq ft studio.  For our fellow professional photogs and artists, please note we will be creating a separate listing to rent the studio for commercial work.  However, for the time being, it is NOT available as a work space. :)   We are NOT currently available as an event space for parties.  This space is exclusively for our Airbnb traveling guests.  Additionally,  travelers who are approved guests of the studio, may NOT host parties, big or small, without written permission of The Studio.   This includes inviting anyone into the premise who was not part of the original reservation.","We will be available the entire length of the guest's stay.

“Experiment the adrenaline of the city from a quiet corner at one of the most representative suburbs, not too visited, vanished by a history not too often told, with locals whose daily train ride offers them someone to share their stories with. That mixture of police news at 8PM with beautiful street murals, electronic music mixed with men dancing in bus stops, mothers who bring their children to preschool mixed with gang members or basketball players, in short, the daily story of millions in the South Side, a side that left an imprint to the African-American heritage in the US, a heritage that is not too often found in books or tour guides, but that is felt and breathed in the air of the Gospel chants, the Mosque’s recites, and the streets of a city inside of a city, lost in a cloud of blurry eyes for those who have been in the ‘blocks’ for decades, with the contrast of a culture of diversity that rises from University of Chicago, the Museum of Science & Industry, the nearby bookstores, the first African American President, the birthplace of House music, the Black History Month, the teens who shoot photographs and listen to their local hip-hop artists, the speakers with basslines that deafen the small streets of this, our neighborhood. By the supermarkets you can see magazine covers announcing the return of those who once gave a name to Chicago, places, sport teams, celebrities who have walked these same sidewalks, faces full of makeup that remember a city that felt like home: the Chicago Bulls, Bears and White Sox, Michael Jordan, Oprah Winfrey, Steve Harvey, Laurence Tureaud (Mr. T), Buddy Guy, Nat King Cole, Muddy Waters, Herbie Hancock, Chaka Khan, Jennifer Hudson, Kel Mitchell, Jennifer Beals, Bernie Mac, Kanye West, Frankie Knuckles, Chance the Rapper, Common or R.

Either the public transit, bike ride, car-share or drive to main attractions and the central business district is quite fast and convenient. 

Public Transit:
You'll find transit directions in most maps apps but here's a few of our favorite options to downtown and nearby attractions just steps away:
• Two Metra stations with two different lines; closest is Stony Island Metra Station which is just a 7-min walk from home and will have you in downtown in 23 minutes (Millennium Park), a ride that makes several stops at nearby attractions and features beautiful panoramic lake views arriving to Millennium Station.
• CTA Bus 28 (Northbound towards Hyde Park) is a 2-min walk from home and will have you at the Univ of Chicago, Hyde Park and nearby attractions on a 12-min ride; or during rush hours to downtown express in 20 to 30 minutes (Grant Park, Columbus Dr/11th, Loop). The bus also stops near the CTA “L” train at Roosevelt Station in Grant Park for the Red, Green and Orange lines.
Chicago's transit system ranks #4 of all major US cities, CTA trains/buses run every 15 minutes in average, while Metra train services run every 25 minutes during rush hours, or every hour at normal times. 

NOTE: Chicago Public Transit offers less frequencies during nighttime, weekends and holidays. There is almost NO public transit coming back home after 11PM. Bus fare is aprox $2.50 and Metra fare is aprox $4.25 per ride and can be paid cash on board, or at the stations for discounted vouchers on multiple rides. Metra offers student discounts at the station.

Driving / Car-Share Services:
Our home is about a 15-min drive from downtown Chicago or the Midway Airport, and about a 38-min drive from O'Hare International Airport (without traffic). You can save on the O’Hare ride by taking the blue line to the city, then using an Uber, Lyft, a taxi ride or the Metra train from Millennium Station. Uber Pool and Lyft Line are widely available in Chicago; for a convenient fare you'll split with other riders you can get to/from downtown at a $12 fare approximately during normal times (not surge). Car-sharing and car rental apps like Turo, Zipcar and Getaround are easy to find and will get you a rental for the hour or the day. Enterprise Rent-A-Car is minutes from home at Stony Island Avenue.
If you prefer to use your own car, our place is conveniently located minutes away from the Chicago Skyway, the 94 and 90 Interstate Highways, and the State Route 41 (Lakeshore Drive).

Parking: 
There's usually plenty of free street parking (no permit required).

Bikes: 
Divvy Bike rentals are available only a few blocks from home and anywhere in the city, and you can pick-up and return the blue bikes anywhere there’s a Divvy station. Biking trails from here to downtown are abundant through the lakefront or the parks.

A percentage of your payment is donated to Open Homes who help evacuees, relief workers and refugees find temporary housing, and work with some of the world’s leading nonprofits that connect people in need: International Rescue Committee, the Cancer Support Community, the All Hands and Hearts disaster relief for natural disasters, and Mercy Corps' global relief for natural disasters and crises.

I am easy to reach to address your needs as I live in the building

The apartment is in the Humboldt park neighborhood, right next to a gorgeous city park that is also called Humboldt. It's a great place to spend some time relaxing as the park contains a boathouse, lagoons, gardens, fieldhouse etc. You can rent paddle boats, go fishing and more. There's a very popular trail nearby called the 606 that is great for a leisure stroll

The neighborhood is rich in culture and the cuisine is excellent. It  neighbors the very popular Logan square and wicker Park neighborhood for dining and nightlife  You will be a short ride from all the action. Getting into downtown could not be easier as there is a bus right infront  of the apartment that takes you right into downtown, magnificent mile, and the ever popular Navy Pier

Public transportation:
To get to downtown (magnificent mile) take the 70 bus that is infront of the apartment going east. To get to Navy Pier take the 65 grand bus.

Ride-sharing: an Uber /Lyft to downtown is typically 12-15 dollars and takes 20-30 mins

There is also a rent a bike docking station right infront of the apartment, $3 for  a 30 minute ride, or $15 for the day

private entrance and are welcome to enjoy the entire apartment.,"We recently moved into this house and heard rumors about strange happenings in and around it, but ignored them. The garden apartment was sealed shut and no matter how hard we tried, we could not open it. One day the door was mysteriously ajar. We entered what looks like house elf quarters! We’re muggles, but the family before us must not have been. Elves are very small, so be warned, the ceilings are very low. Anyone 6’ or taller may want to book elsewhere, or be ready to slouch.

The space has 2 bedrooms. One with a queen bed and one with a full size bed. Both bedrooms have closets. The living room has a couch and a 50” Netflix enabled (amazon fire stick) television. The bathroom has a stand up shower, no tub. The dining rooms seats 4-5. The kitchen includes a coffee maker, toaster, microwave, refrigerator, and stove. The entire apartment is yours. It is below another apartment so there may be some noise/footsteps, but we do our best to keep it down at night and early in the morning. The ceilings are about 6’ tall and lower in some places, so please consider this before booking. Please let us know if you’re interested in purchasing parking passes PRIOR to your arrival, each pass is an additional $10 for 24 hours of street parking. We may have last minute passes available, so don’t hesitate to ask, but requesting parking while booking is the best way to ensure that we’re able to provide you with as many passes as you’ll need. The Belmont blue line stop is a 6 minute walk from your door.

Guests have a private entrance and are welcome to enjoy the entire apartment.

The space is entirely private so we rarely see guests face to face. Please let me know what time you plan on checking in and out prior to your arrival. Please also mark yourself checked in or send me a message when you arrive, as well as when you check out so that I can have the space available for the next guest as soon as possible. Thank you! We live in the same building but travel quite frequently . Ideally, I will be around to assist with anything you need. If we will be out of town, I will definitely let you know beforehand and make sure you have everything you need to make the stay comfortable.

Our neighborhood is quiet and safe with a residential feel to it. There is a bar at the end of the street and other nearby places to eat and drink up Belmont if you want to escape the quiet neighborhood. We’re very close to public transportation as well.

We are a 6 minute walk from the Belmont blue line stop which will take you just about anywhere in the city. We offer $10/day parking passes if you wish to drive yourself around and need a safe place to park your car at night, just inquire when booking. Uber and Lyft drivers are always in the area and offer safe affordable transportation options.

Quiet hours:
Sun-Thurs 9pm-6am
Fri-Sat 2am-8am

WARNING: Low ceilings, around 6’ high and lower in some areas. 
This is a garden apartment so it’s below another apartment. Some noise/footsteps should be expected.

I can not guarantee an early check-in time. I can usually make it happen, but it depends on when the previous guests check out and how much of a mess is left behind. For this reason, I can never guarantee an exact time when guests request early check-in. Please let me know if you would like to check in early and I  do my best to get the place ready for you ASAP! I will send you a message as soon as it is available for check-in. I do not offer luggage drop off prior to check-in time or late check-outs.

For this reason, I can never guarantee an exact time when guests request early check-in. Please let me know if you would like to check in early and I  do my best to get the place ready for you ASAP! I will send you a message as soon as it is available for check-in. I do not offer luggage drop off prior to check-in time or late check-outs.

R18000031870","The space has 2 bedrooms. One with a queen bed and one with a full size bed. Both bedrooms have closets. The living room has a couch and a 50” Netflix enabled (amazon fire stick) television. The bathroom has a stand up shower, no tub. The dining rooms seats 4-5. The kitchen includes a coffee maker, toaster, microwave, refrigerator, and stove. The entire apartment is yours. It is below another apartment so there may be some noise/footsteps, but we do our best to keep it down at night and early in the morning. The ceilings are about 6’ tall and lower in some places, so please consider this before booking. Please let us know if you’re interested in purchasing parking passes PRIOR to your arrival, each pass is an additional $10 for 24 hours of street parking. We may have last minute passes available, so don’t hesitate to ask, but requesting parking while booking is the best way to ensure that we’re able to provide you with as many passes as you’ll need. The Belmont blue line stop is a 6 minute walk from your door.","We recently moved into this house and heard rumors about strange happenings in and around it, but ignored them. The garden apartment was sealed shut and no matter how hard we tried, we could not open it. One day the door was mysteriously ajar. We entered what looks like house elf quarters! We’re muggles, but the family before us must not have been. Elves are very small, so be warned, the ceilings are very low. Anyone 6’ or taller may want to book elsewhere, or be ready to slouch.","We are a 6 minute walk from the Belmont blue line stop which will take you just about anywhere in the city. We offer $10/day parking passes if you wish to drive yourself around and need a safe place to park your car at night, just inquire when booking. Uber and Lyft drivers are always in the area and offer safe affordable transportation options.",True,True,False,False,,True,False,30.0,"[{'milestones': {'titles': ['<b>Jan 11, 5:00PM</b>', 'Check-in'], 'subtitles': [], 'type': 'check_in'}, 'localized_cancellation_policy_name': 'Moderate', 'cancellation_policy_label': 'moderate', 'cancellation_policy_price_type': None, 'cancellation_policy_price_factor': 0.0, 'cancellation_policy_id': 4, 'book_it_module_tooltip': 'Free cancellation for 48 hours', 'subtitle': 'After that, cancel before 5:00PM on Jan 6 and get a full refund, minus the service fee.'}]",0.0,20.0,4,2020-01-11,2020-01-12,2019-12-28,2019-12-17 22:13:40+00:00,2018-09-27 21:17:35+00:00

5.	Empty/clean sink trap/drain catch and sponge or towel
6.	Don’t forget to wash the spoon rest from the stove after use

10.	Wipe down the counter with a paper towel and Lysol
(located in spray bottle under sink)

Come & go as you please. There is access to a large back yard and deck enjoyable in the summertime. As previously mentioned, there is driveway access and walkability to the train. 

For commuting access: Metra 1 block away to get to downtown Chicago, La Grange, Naperville, or Aurora (BNSF is an easy and west bound train). Downtown Downers Grove 1 mile away westbound. Downtown Westmont 1 mile away eastbound. I-88 is 1.5 miles away, I-294 is 3 miles away, and I-355 is 2 miles away. Pace buses allow for local commuting. If you need a short ride though, I’ll likely provide one for gratis ;-)","Welcome to my clean and happy abode! “Mi casa es tu casa,” is the motto. I am a friendly host, who loves having AirBnb guests.

Sleep on your choice of a new, large leather sectional, or the pullout twin bed, which is converted from a custom Pottery Barn honey-colored chair. 

No need for a car; Metra is as close as possible and is walking distance! 

Imagine staying in a home with a happy, young professional host, and you’ve got your stay in Downers Grove.  Come live like a Chicago suburbanite!

The Chicago western suburbs are extremely safe and friendly. While many parts of Chicago have affluent neighborhoods, you’ll find in some places, the town nextdoor a mile away is a bit sketch. Not in Downers Grove: you’re insulated from crime by having many other nice, neighboring towns in Dupage County such as Westmont, Lombard, Naperville, Woodridge, Western Springs, Hinsdale, and Oak Brook. 

From the house, you have convenience to all sorts of shops and restaurants. Looking for groceries? Try Standard Market! The best specialty foods and high-quality grocer in the United States is only a mile away (dry-aged steaks, fantastic seafood, fancy cheeses, and the freshest produce, I cannot emphasize how amazing this place is!). Want to have a bite to eat? Neat Kitchen & Bar is one mile East in Westmont, featuring hip, New American food & atmosphere. There’s also the local Chicago hot dog and gyro joint, The Eagle Restaurant, just around the corner and about a two-minutes walk from the house. Want to experience local breweries? Emmet’s is one mile west off the same street as the house, and Alter Brewing Co. is another great microbrewer 2 miles from downtown Downers Grove off of Belmont Rd. 

There’s so many places in the suburbs, but downtown Chicago is easily accessible as well! Leave the car behind: getting downtown is easy. Take a 4 minute walk to the train station, and you can be downtown in less than half an hour via the Metra line BNSF. 

With all your urban exploring and adventuring, I’ll make sure your stay is comfortable and restful. At the house, I will provide you fresh linens with two white sheets, a blanket, and two standard cotton bed pillows to sleep on. I make sure to make the space as comfortable and clean as possible. I literally clean every day, guest or not. 

For your things, there is available a small living room closet, with a hanger bar for clothing. You’re also free to pile your bags in the corner if that’s your style. 

The house features hardwood throughout, kitchen access, and a big yard and deck. Private parking is available in the spacious driveway. If you need to do laundry, there is a washer and dryer, ironing board, and a Swash Machine. I will also provide you a fresh towel and wash cloth, hotel-style shampoo & soaps, and blow-dryer and styling tools if needed. The bathroom features a heated fan which is amazing for Chicago winters!

Last to mention is the beta fish, George, who is amazingly friendly and agile for a fish. He likes to be pet and have human interaction, and he will do jumps for his food! He sits in a 5 gallon tank on the table in the kitchen, keeping you company when you want to sit and eat a snack. George will help you bring home a unique story for your nice stay! 

While you stay in Downers Grove, anything you need, just ask. Mi casa es tu casa, and I believe you will truly enjoy this shared space.

Guests have considerable space in the house. Living room, bathroom, kitchen are all open- you def aren’t confined to a small space. Also the closet in the living room is open for use.

The Downers Grove and Westmont area is part of the beautiful and affluent western Chicago suburbs. Both have downtowns with many neat restaurants, shops, and bars if you would like to go out to eat or are looking for an evening hang out locally. Downtown Downers is 1 mile west, Westmont 1 mile east. 

The house is walking distance to the Metra, 7/11 & Speedway, the Eagle Restaurant, Burlington Barber Shop, Treehouse Arts Center, and multiple parks and forest preserves. On weekdays, the BNSF Metra line will get you to downtown Chicago in 25 minutes, and on weekends, Metra rides are 50 minutes. The line can also take you west to Naperville and Aurora. 

This area is great for recreation. Runners will have plenty of nice flat paths including one that will take you through the forest preserve. Waterfall Glen, which features over 9 miles of hilly crushed limestone paths, is only a few miles away. For a nature-renowned treat, visit the Morton Arboretum in Lisle, located just 4 miles from the house. If there’s snow on the ground, try cross-country skiing at the Morton for a very affordable price! 

For golfers, there are multiple courses within a 5 mile radius, some of which even offer rental clubs, perfect for those traveling. I suggest Downers Grove Golf Club, the oldest golf course in North America, which is only a few miles away in the same town.

For public transportation, the metra is one block away: BNSF Fairview Ave. Driving in this area is easy with nearby highways I-355, I-88, and I-294. Parking is available in the driveway.

Because I pride the home for cleanliness, please respect this as well as a priority. Take your shoes off before walking around the house. Clean your dishes and take-out boxes right away. Don’t leave a wet towel or blankets tossed around the living room. I’ve had a string of really respectful and fun guests, and I’d like to keep it that way.","Keep common sense, like cleaning up after yourself in common areas. Check-out is noon on your last day of stay. No shoes in the house please. Must use hair strainer in the shower.

Along North, Division, Milwaukee and Damen Avenues, you will find an unbelievable blend of vintage shops amid independently-owned boutiques touting fashions for both men and women, and luxury home goods and beauty products. On the same blocks are nationally-recognized names in fashion, and a mix of major retail chains that have also set up shop to satisfy the on-trend crowds.""

The front bedroom faces the street and there will be city sounds as this is a busy neighborhood. Please be respectful with your noise level, and no parties or loud music. Any noise complaints will be immediately reported to the police. Please treat our home as you would want your home treated! Thank you in advance :)","This large vintage apartment is located in the heart of Wicker Park, one of Chicago's most popular and safe neighborhoods. Our building was constructed in the 1890s. We are close to tons of stores and restaurants. In fact, our apartment is above a great Mediterranean restaurant and across the street from a delicious diner. A new tavern just went in next door and you are within minutes of the vibrant Wicker Park restaurant and bar scene. 

We are a 15 minute Uber ride from downtown Chicago. There is a bus stop right outside our front door. Walk 8 minutes to the ""El"" (Chicago's elevated train system) and ride anywhere in the city for just a couple of dollars. Perfect home for a business traveler. It is also great for groups or families because we can accommodate up to 8 people with three queen sized beds, one queen sized air mattress, and one full sized sofa pullout. 

Check-in is a breeze with keypads on both the front and back doors to the apartment. Once inside, feel free to adjust the heat/central air to your liking. There are also three space heaters and a window heating/air conditioning unit that you can use as needed.

There is plentiful free street parking on the side streets surrounding the apartment. There is also paid street parking right in front of the apartment that is $4 for 2 hours until 10pm, and then it is free overnight until 8am. I never have to park more than a block away from the apartment and the neighborhood is very safe. 

We have very fast WiFi and a Roku TV that you can use to log into your Netflix, HBO Go, Amazon Prime, etc. We also have Alexa in the living room.

All three bedrooms house comfortable queen sized beds with fresh, clean linens. Our couch pulls out into a full sized bed. We also have a queen sized air mattress. You can comfortably sleep 8 people in this space. 

We have towels for all guests as well as extra toiletries such as face wash, toothpaste, toothbrushes, tampons, lotion, etc. We also provide body wash, shampoo, and conditioner. 

If you love to cook, you will love our kitchen. Feel free to use our cookware and spices as well as our gas stove and oven. You wont ever pine away for a spatula or a dish; we live in this house when we are in the country and it is well stocked. There is a Keurig coffee maker available for your use. There is also a lot of space for dining and serving: we have a dining table in both the kitchen and the dining room with room for up to ten. 

The  washer and dryer are in the apartment and are available for your use. Detergent and fabric softener are provided.

Our apartment is clean and spacious. It is a great home base for your stay in Chicago!","Welcome to Wicker Park! Perfect location to explore the city, 20 min from the loop, 8 minutes away from the blue line,  and all buses leave from the front door.

Our space is fully stocked so you feel like you're at home. Enjoy a Keurig coffee maker, free toiletries, comfortable beds, a Roku TV, and the fastest internet you can get in the city.

You can get there by Uber or public transportation. Parking is free on the street. Right in front of the building it’s free but you’re not supposed to park there when there is events in United Center. But on the two other street of each corner of the street where the building is you can park for free as well

The room is private but you will share common areas ( kitchen , living room, and the bathroom/s) with other Airbnb guests. Usually none of this get crowd because most of Airbnb guests are most of the time outside the house knowing the city, in concerts, interviews, etc, and they don’t spend much time in the house. A private apartment in the area usually cost over 120$ p/night plus taxes and fees which is in total almost 200$ p/night ! If you want save some money and being close to downtown, surrounding great public transportation and with free street parking this could be a great option for you! 
The room has one full size bed. If you want to add 3rd or 4th guest in the reservation I could add 1 extra air mattress with no extra fee if the reservation is set for 3 or 4. If the reservation is for 2 and you’d like to have an extra air mattress we charge $15p/night and we provide air mattress and linens for it. the room will become smaller for luggage becase you will have two beds on it. This is a good option if you want to save even more money otherwise you can book two rooms! 
As most houses in United States this is not made with concrete so you will hear people walking or outside sounds. It doesn’t bother most of the guest but if you are a very light sleeper maybe you should choose an entire place. or have an earphone or something to block the sound. There will be security cameras ON in shared spaces only( living room, kitchen, hallways, entrance of the apartment, exits of the apartment).","There will be security cameras ON in shared spaces only( living room, kitchen, hallways, entrance of the apartment, exits of the apartment).",,"Only ONE BLOCK away from United Center(5min walking).

Well, now’s your chance to bring that fantasy to life. During your stay, the whole apartment is yours and only yours.","Welcome to Chicago, home of the World Series Champs, the Cubs. Our Studio condo is a perfect place to stay on any Chicago getaway, whether business or vacation. It is professionally designed with a full kitchen, living room, and modern decor. 

Street parking is limited  and it is difficult to park at night, we recommend parking your car once and taking the train for your entire stay. The Wellington L Station is just a 10 minutes walk away.

In the heart of trendy Boystown Chicago, our sophisticated studio apartment is the perfect launchpad for Windy City adventures or clinching that important business deal. Whatever brings you to town, you’ll rest easy in our charming, quiet neighborhood with easy access to the Red Line train to take you south to Downtown or north to Loyola and Evanston.

Illuminated by sunny natural light, our studio features Queen-size bed, premium linens, and plenty of closet space so you can unpack and forget about your suitcase for a while. Enjoy the privacy of your own room, with doors that close and independently controlled air-conditioning units.

The apartment includes one full bathroom, with a shower, sink, and toilet. We’re all about helping you look (and smell) your best, so we provide shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in addition to hand soap and fluffy towels. Trust us when we say there’s no better way to warm up after a Windy City walk than a hot shower!

There’s ample space for guests to relax on the sofa and watch on a large flat-screen TV. Like the rest of the unit, you’ll live it up in luxury among hardwood floors and contemporary decor. The entire place has free, fast WiFi and Chicago sunshine streaming in through the windows.

Whether you’re craving a home-cooked meal or just somewhere to put the box of deep-dish, our kitchen is fully stocked with cookware, dishes, utensils, and has swanky granite countertop. Appliances include a full-sized fridge and freezer, gas stove, oven, microwave, toaster, and coffee maker. There is a common laundry area for guests which they can use during their stay. The only things missing are your favorite farmer’s market finds!!

Ever dreamed about jetting off to your own Chicago apartment? Well, now’s your chance to bring that fantasy to life. During your stay, the whole apartment is yours and only yours.

We’re all about giving you plenty of privacy and personal space, so we’ll be available by phone (call or text) during your stay.

What’s better than staying in the heart of Downtown Chicago? How about an apartment that gives you the best of both worlds: minutes from the most exciting attractions of the Magnificent Mile and Navy Pier, but far enough away that you can get a taste of authentic Chi-Town life like a local.

Our place is a 10-minute walk from the Wellington L Station which can take you straight into Downtown. Our neighborhood itself, though, is best explored foot, so you can meander through the quaint boutiques and tasty eateries while enjoying the lush trees that line the streets. Walk just 10 minutes east and you’ll stumble upon the spectacular Lakefront Trail, which offers panoramic views of Lake Michigan and is a fantastic place to run, walk, and people watch.

You’ll never go hungry in this ‘hood. Some of our favorite places to eat include Crisp, known for Korean-style fried chicken, Chilam Balam for Mexican small plates, and the delicious Mediterranean fare at Troy. When you’re craving something sweet, walk just 2 minutes to Bobtail Ice Cream for a milkshake, sundae, or a scoop of their chocolate chip merlot ice cream. Or chocolate ice cream infused with Jack Daniels, if that’s what you’re into.

In the mood for a night on the town but you don’t want to deal with the crowds Downtown? There are plenty of low-key, exciting, sophisticated, and eclectic bars here that will be perfect for the kind of evening you want to have. From the whisky-centric Duke Of Perth to the 80-year-old Jake's Pub (they even have a jukebox) to Bar Pastoral’s wine and cheese expertise, there’s something for everyone.

And if you just want to relax and watch a show, you have options within walking distance. Catch the latest blockbuster at Landmark's Century Centre Cinema or a live drama at TimeLine Theatre Company, both about 5 minutes from our place. Not much further away are the Laugh Factory comedy club and the Blue Man Group’s Briar Street Theater for more live entertainment.

Why break the bank with a pricey rental car when you can take advantage of Chicago’s top-notch public transportation system? Our place is just a 10-minute walk from Wellington Station, where you can catch the Brown Line and the Purple/Red Line. Any line will take you to Downtown Chicago in just about 15 minutes, or you can head north to Uptown or Evanston on the Red Line, which later turns into the Purple Line.

Flying into Chicago? We’re a 25-minute drive from O’Hare when there is no traffic, but if there is traffic you may be better off taking public transit (and saving some $$ on the taxi or Uber fare). Take the Blue Line from O’Hare to Clark/Lake, then transfer to the Brown Line to Wellington Station. Or, transfer from the Blue Line to the bus, depending on what time of day you’re traveling.

In addition to public transit, ridesharing (Uber or Lyft) is also a great way to get around the Chicago metro. When you’re heading out with a group or want that extra little bit of luxury, just request a ride - they’re readily available and can take you anywhere you want to go.

"1. You're living like a local, be respectful of the other locals. We mean, c'mon, how would you feel if your neighbor wasn't super awesome? 

2. All of our Rental Units are smoke-free environments. Even on the balcony, if you have one. We're super sorry if this is a bummer, but it's our policy. Hopefully we told you about it ahead of time and you aren't super surprised that we still mean it. 

3. Pets are super awesome, but they aren't allowed in our Rental Units. However, if your fur kiddo is a service animal then give us a call and we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your needs, as required by law.  

4. Your trip details should already be complete. If they aren't, give us a call ASAP so we can rectify that! What's a little information between friends?  

5. Your friend, your responsibility. Pretty simple, if you invite them to your Rental Unit, you're responsible for their actions.  

6. While watching a million people get out of a clown car is hilarious, there are occupancy rules Stay Alfred must follow for each of our buildings. Help us follow the rules and check your rental contract for occupancy requirements. If you exceed it, don't worry! Give us a call and we'll get you one of our bigger travel apartments. (It's like needing an Uber XL when you have a ton of people with you!) 

7. We're here to help! The onsite building staff doesn't work for Stay Alfred…strange, right? So, if you need something, send us a chat, or just give us a call. Our awesome Guest Services department will assist you 24/7.

8. Take only memories, leave only the keys, fobs, parking passes, etc. behind. They won't help you out when you get home and it's a total pain to have to replace them. 

9. We love gifts, but the greatest gift is making sure you don't leave anything behind. We suggest taking one last look around before you head home as fees are associated with sending you your belongings. Trust us, the extra five minutes is worth it! 

10. Ugh, here's the hard one. Should you break anything, really mess something up, or decide to stay longer than your agreed upon length of stay, we have the right to charge you additional fees, but we'd really rather not (and, we're sure you'd rather not too!)

11. Guests must be 21 years of age or older to make a Reservation, and the Guest who made the Reservation must be present for the duration of the stay. If the Guest who made the Reservation isn't present during the stay, occupants may be removed from the Rental Unit, and the Reservation may be canceled without refund.",2 baths,3 beds,2 bedrooms,6

neighborhood.

Among the shops, restaurants, and attractions of Chicago's exciting Gold Coast district, these elegant travel apartments offer style and sophistication everywhere you look. From the tall ceilings to the gorgeous dark-wood cabinets in each unit to the expansive rooftop terrace and barbecue stations, there's no better place to relax and recharge on a whirlwind trip to Chi-Town. The building's common areas are anything but common - including a cozy game room and a state-of-the-art gym - and the fireplaces in the lobby offer an ideal place to cozy up in the middle of a chilly Chicago winter.

We believe in personal space. Prior to your arrival, your unit will be professionally cleaned and your self guided check in process ensures easy arrival with no long lines. Should you need us, we're here 24/7 with our guest services team and local folks on the ground. And if you don't need us, we'll stay out of your way. After all, this is your place in the city.

Ready to experience the best of Chi-Town? The vibrant Gold Coast neighborhood is the perfect home base for any Windy City adventure: Whether you want to take your Chicago vacation to new heights at the 94th-floor 360 Chicago observation deck or down closer to sea level on the scenic coast of Lake Michigan, you're in the middle of it all. The neighborhood is home to Armani, Barney's,Chanel, Jimmy Choo and Tom Ford, and steps away from more great shopping, including the high-end 900 North Michigan Shops and the huge Water Tower Place. Cultural landmarks like the Museum of Contemporary Art and Loyola University's Museum of Art are also close at hand.

We furnish all of our properties to a uniform standard, but individual units may differ slightly from the pictures shown.","1. You're living like a local, be respectful of the other locals. We mean, c'mon, how would you feel if your neighbor wasn't super awesome? 

2. All of our Rental Units are smoke-free environments. Even on the balcony, if you have one. We're super sorry if this is a bummer, but it's our policy. Hopefully we told you about it ahead of time and you aren't super surprised that we still mean it. 

3. Pets are super awesome, but they aren't allowed in our Rental Units. However, if your fur kiddo is a service animal then give us a call and we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your needs, as required by law.  

4. Your trip details should already be complete. If they aren't, give us a call ASAP so we can rectify that! What's a little information between friends?  

5. Your friend, your responsibility. Pretty simple, if you invite them to your Rental Unit, you're responsible for their actions.  

6. While watching a million people get out of a clown car is hilarious, there are occupancy rules Stay Alfred must follow for each of our buildings. Help us follow the rules and check your rental contract for occupancy requirements. If you exceed it, don't worry! Give us a call and we'll get you one of our bigger travel apartments. (It's like needing an Uber XL when you have a ton of people with you!) 

7. We're here to help! The onsite building staff doesn't work for Stay Alfred…strange, right? So, if you need something, send us a chat, or just give us a call. Our awesome Guest Services department will assist you 24/7.

8. Take only memories, leave only the keys, fobs, parking passes, etc. behind. They won't help you out when you get home and it's a total pain to have to replace them. 

9. We love gifts, but the greatest gift is making sure you don't leave anything behind. We suggest taking one last look around before you head home as fees are associated with sending you your belongings. Trust us, the extra five minutes is worth it! 

10. Ugh, here's the hard one. Should you break anything, really mess something up, or decide to stay longer than your agreed upon length of stay, we have the right to charge you additional fees, but we'd really rather not (and, we're sure you'd rather not too!)

11. Guests must be 21 years of age or older to make a Reservation, and the Guest who made the Reservation must be present for the duration of the stay. If the Guest who made the Reservation isn't present during the stay, occupants may be removed from the Rental Unit, and the Reservation may be canceled without refund.","We believe in personal space. Prior to your arrival, your unit will be professionally cleaned and your self guided check in process ensures easy arrival with no long lines.

A pull-out couch in the living room means that 4 people can stay comfortably.

My charming 1BR apartment is on the third floor of a courtyard building in Edgewater, a quiet, residential neighborhood just north of Andersonville.

[Please note there is no elevator in the building.]

The bedroom has a double bed. The living room has a pull-out sofa that sleeps 2 (comfortable, I promise) if you'd like to fit more people in.

The kitchen is well-equipped (I like to cook) and has a breakfast nook with seating for 4.

I have an Apple tv (hulu, netflix, hbogo) and broadcast tv.

In the summer I have a window a/c unit that cools the living room and bedroom.

Andersonville is about a 10-minute walk away, and is a great neighborhood for coffee, brunch, craft beer bars, dining, and shopping, especially if you like antique or repurposed furniture.

You will have the entire apartment.

I usually let the apartment when I'm out of town. You'll access the keys from a lockbox outside the building, and I'm available by phone or text during your stay.

I'm a 5-10 minute walk to the red line of the el train, which will get you downtown in about 30 minutes. I'm also within a few blocks of several buses. If you're coming into town for a specific reason, I can give you an idea of how you would get there from my place and how long it would take you.

There is free street parking in the neighborhood - availability depends on when you're looking for a spot. During the day it's pretty easy to find a spot on my block or less than a block away. The later it gets into the evening the longer you might have to look, but generally you'll be able to find a spot in less than 10 minutes.",,"I usually let the apartment when I'm out of town.

Living room with couch and TV","Come enjoy a spacious, yet cozy retreat in Lakeview for 1-2 guests. Through a private entrance you’ll find a 1,400 sq ft lower level with a private bedroom/bathroom, shared living space & patio.

Steps away from Wrigley Field, the lake and the Wrigleyville and Boystown neighborhoods. Two blocks from public transit for easy access to much of what Chicago has to offer. Note: we have a non-shedding Goldendoodle (see more below).

This is a private room in our home for 1-2 guests. We live upstairs with our Goldendoodle. 

This space is perfect for solo travelers, friends or a couple coming to the Lakeview neighborhood. Whether you are catching a game or concert at Wrigley, exploring Lakeview, Wrigleyville, Lincoln Park, Boystown, or just in town for some good ole' fashioned fun, we look forward to hosting you.  

Our home is a duplex down. We live upstairs and your private entrance, bedroom, bathroom and the shared living space are on the lower level. Like many other duplex downs, ours has something called a light well to allow more natural light into the lower level. Because of this, we’ll definitely be able to hear each other in the shared spaces. We are very conscious of being quiet in the morning and at night as to not disturb you. We ask that you are respectful when it comes to noise and do not bring other people into the unit without first letting us know.

Note: As mentioned above, we have a teddy-bear looking Goldendoodle named Ruxbin. He's friendly, well-trained and respectful of your things. He goes to daycare some days of the week and others he is at home. We are happy to keep him upstairs with us. If you have any questions about him, please let us know. 

A few more things you can expect during your stay --

* On the bar you will find your own Keurig coffee machine, tea and some breakfast snacks.

* In the family room there is a smart TV with Xfinity cable and in the bedroom there is a TV with a Roku (already logged into Netflix and Amazon Prime). 

* You are welcome to keep food in the fridge downstairs and/or freezer upstairs, and use our kitchen to whip up something to eat.

* From Midway or O'Hare public transportation will have you at our condo in about an hour. Happy to help you navigate CTA.

We live upstairs in the apartment. One of us is usually working from home and is able to help if you need anything during your stay. And of course we are always available by phone or email if you need anything during your stay. If we are not home to let you in when you arrive, we will provide you with keys in a lockbox.

This condo sits on a quiet, tree-lined street in Lakeview close to all Lakeview, Wrigleyville, Boystown and the lakefront have to offer.

We'll provide you with a list of our favorite spots.

Carter II is situated in the beautiful Kenwood area, one of Chicago's most affluent neighborhoods in Bronzeville.

From Muddy Waters to Muhammad Ali and longtime White Sox owner Bill Veeck, some of Chicago's best have called Kenwood home. This remarkable neighborhood on the city's South Side was once a refuge for Chicago's elite who, to escape the clamor of downtown Chicago, built enormous homes on the Lake Michigan shoreline. Today, Kenwood gracefully echoes its lavish beginnings with historic streets, official Landmarks and an ever-growing commercial district.

For the architecture buff, Kenwood vaunts an impressive collection of Art Deco high-rises from the early twentieth century. Walking through the neighborhood's Indian Village district, visitors are greeted by the Powhatan Apartments and the Chicago Beach Hotel (now Regents Park), which are both recognized by the National Register of Historic Places.

Artistically inclined visitors will be amazed by the Hyde Park Art Center, a community center that offers major exhibitions and a lively calendar of must-see events.  If taking in the celebrated works of local artists gives you an appetite, the nearby Norman's Bistro gives you a  jazzy vibe and delicious food.  (don't go hungry because the service is slow)

A walkable community that is near public (bus and rail) transportation, local eateries, galleries, and shops.  Plenty of free street parking.

House is on a tree-lined street with several greystones and a major high school.    There is free street parking.   However, during the week you can only park on one side of the street until school is out.","Flameless candles are only allowed.

The room comes with a double sink bathroom, full bath (with a jacuzzi feature), and a large walk-in closet! This master suite is at your own end of the apartment with its own entrance so you will have it all to yourself. However we live next door and walls might be thin so keep that in mind.

We offer self check-in and check-out, but are available for questions if needed. Your privacy and comfort is our #1 priority.

The upstairs is my personal apartment.","A private basement available in Lincoln Park 2 flat, a nice neighborhood near downtown. The basement will accommodate two people very comfortably with 2 seperate beds, wireless internet, private bathroom with a BASIC/MINIMALIST set up.

The layout allows for a lot of privacy as your rooms and bathroom are located in the basement area of my home. I work from home and occupy the upstairs. I operate an Organic Catering Company called ""Goose & Fox"", as well as a recording studio. The building itself is over 100 years old and located in awesome part of town.

We have a shared lounge, bathroom and table space available to guests. The upstairs is my personal apartment.

I try to give my guests as much space as I think they want or need.

If I am around, I am accessible but not in your space, meaning I am working in my office with the door slightly cracked or doing something upstairs while you are downstairs in your bedroom or bathroom. I also operate a recording studio so sometimes I am upstairs recording stuff. I also have two friendly dogs who generally hang with me in the office. They sometimes bark when people arrive but are super friendly after a couple minutes. They do not have access to the basement.

On the other hand, if you need answers or just want to talk, I always enjoy this part of the host experience.

I try to let the guest set the pace when it comes to how much interaction we have.

The place is located in the heart of Historic Lincoln Park with easy access to the Armitage Brown Line stop and the ""el"".  We are in the best possible location if you need access to downtown we are literally a 5-10 minute train ride away.

Lincoln Park is home to DePaul University and boasts tree-lined lakefront paths for biking/jogging, a vibrant shopping district, beach, dozens of ethnically diverse restaurants, live music venues, movie theaters and more. north avenue beach, and the lakefront, are less than 10 minutes from our home.

Breakfast is offered at an additional charge with your stay but you must verify the time  you want prior to your arrival or the day before when you arrive. Breakfast can be served at any time and is cooked to order so you can sleep in if you need to, but you must arrange it with the host so we can make sure we have everything we need to give you a great breakfast. 


-full cooked to order breakfast (omelettes, frittattas, potatoes, french toast, pancakes, locally sourced bacon, biscuits & gravy, eggs benedict. special dietary needs are no problem! Your Host is a world class Chef so we can pretty much make anything and it will always be awesome!

I DO NOT PROVIDE PARKING. STOP ASKING ME ABOUT PARKING. WE ARE LOCATED IN A LARGE CITY. PARKING IS DIFFICULT. Public transit is a much better option.

Buses and trains are literally ride outside my front door and about a minute walk from the apartment (train ride downtown is then only a 10 minute ride)

Cabs: No more than a moments wait to flag a cab directly out front of my place day and night. This is a safe area where you can walk around at night as well.

Parking: We are about 5 minutes from downtown so Parking is limited, random and mostly based on luck like any populated urban area. research the neighborhood and plan ahead. I do not provide parking and due to the popularity of the area my recommendations will only go so far. Our location is great for public transit, which we recommend you use.

Or reserve your spot with Spot Hero:

Hostels provide budget-oriented, sociable accommodation where guests can rent a bed, usually a bunk bed, in a dormitory and share a bathroom, lounge and sometimes a kitchen.

There are several differences between hostels and hotels, including:
Hostels tend to be budget-oriented; rates are considerably lower.
For those who prefer an informal environment, hostels do not usually have the same level of formality as hotels.
For those who prefer to socialize with their fellow guests, hostels usually have more common areas and opportunities to socialize. The dormitory aspect of hostels also increases the social factor.
Hostels are generally self-catering.

PLEASE DO NOT
- Do anything illegal
- Smoke inside (Thank You)
- Invite guests over without prior written approval
-ask me about parking (do the research, (Hidden by Airbnb) directions)

Valid IDs will be required upon checking in.
I can be very flexible with move in and move out times as long as I can get the apartment cleaned for the next airbnb client

DISCLAIMER!
Now that I have hosted for over a year, I generally prefer more laid back guests who have experience with airbnb. Specifically, Millenials, Artistic types and younger folks going to concerts, work trips etc. This space is not exactly the four seasons but I do my best to make it comfy and affordable. If you are an older more discerning traveler who is going to not follow the rules, read my ad or at least send me some basic info on the why, when and where when you attempt to book it probably be best for you to stay at a hotel.

In furtherance of that objective we are developing loyalty programs which give special incentives and attention to returning guests and their friends and family members.  While there can always be small mistakes and oversights at any property (no one is perfect 100% of the time), with us you know we will do everything in our power to make your stay fantastic. 

This lovely home is truly a vacation rental in the city.

Pack and play available upon request.

☹PLEASE BE AWARE THAT WE DO HAVE A STRICTLY ENFORCED NON-PARTY/NO UNAUTHORIZED VISITORS POLICY IN PLACE AND WE DO MONITOR OUR SECURITY CAMERAS VIGILANTLY SO WE KNOW IF A BOOKING IS IN VIOLATION OF THAT POLICY.

☻Responsible conduct by hosts and guests alike will help ensure Chicago and suburbs do not follow the lead of Santa Monica, San Francisco, New York City and Oahu in banning airbnbs altogether in their districts.☻

For reservations longer than 7 days, we will need to do a weekly inspection of the property.

You will be able to access the entire home with the exception of any locked closets or bedrooms.

The house is on a quiet residential block in the historic neighborhood of South Shore.  South Shore is an African American cultural mecca which has gone through some ups and downs over the past half-century.  The neighborhood attracts artists, professionals, academicians and its residents are proud of its history. This is the neighborhood where Michelle Obama grew up, a mile west of the house on 74th Street & Euclid, and where the young Obama couple resided while launching the former President's political career after they both graduated from Harvard Law School.

South Shore’s proximity to downtown Chicago (about 20 minutes drive up Lake Shore Drive),  to the Lake (about a 10 min walk) to the future Obama Presidential Library (7 min drive) and the proposed Tiger Woods championship golf course (uniting the existing Jackson Park and South Shore golf courses) are major forces contributing to the neighborhood’s renaissance.  

The location is economically diverse (low, middle and upper middle income households) with a smattering of abandoned and boarded up buildings littered throughout the area.  (There are two boarded up homes right across the street, so if this is an issue please do not book).  However, you will also see many well maintained homes, aggressive rehab activity in the area and some grand, stunning historic homes along the lakefront and west of Jeffrey Blvd.  A new blues/jazz club, “The Quarry” has opened on Exchange and is within walking distance as is the cafe “South Shore Brew”, Majani’s Vegan Restaurant, and Chef Sarah’s Cafe.  

Most of the smaller rehabbed homes in South Shore are selling briskly between 300-500K which tells me a lot about how the market (ie prospective buyers) views the prospects for this still affordable lakefront community.  The larger, non-rehabbed homes appear to be selling above 600K price point.  There are 4 decent eateries all within walking distance -- L&G Diner, Sarah's Cafe, Majani's and South Shore Brew.  The nearest grocery store, Whole Foods, is a 15 minute drive, but Stop & Save, a supermarket chain, is slated to open its doors in Fall 2019 at 71st & Jeffrey, a 5 minute drive.  A proposed entertainment complex consisting of a 7-screen cinema theatre and fine dining options is due to go up also on 71st & Jeffrey.

I feel safe in this neighborhood because I know what precautions I ought to take.  For example, I would not recommend female guests walk around the neighborhood alone and I would not recommend ANY guests to walk around the neighborhood super late at night.  (That would also be my advice for any Chicago neighborhood, by the way).  Guests have walked late at night in the neighborhood and been just fine, but I like to advise caution.  Daytime and evening strolls are perfectly safe.  In fact you will see many bicyclists using the Lake Shore Drive bike path.  The block is hospitable and neighborly.  Our neighbors have a vested interest in ensuring that you feel at home as your presence contributes to the ongoing revitalization of the area and all that means for local job creation, property values etc.  Despite all the bad publicity the City of Chicago receives, let’s just say that few, if even any, who live here (or know South Shore, as do I) feel unsafe.  I have stayed at this house for long stretches of time as I prepared it for its opening.  I have hosted family, including my mother, at this home.  

In essence, guests are giving up staying in arguably “better” Chicago neighborhoods but are gaining the following: 1) value; 2) space; 3) comfort; 4) easy access to the city via public transport.  

We kindly ask that you weigh those pros (pricing, comfort, space, superb location) against the cons (neighborhood which has seen better days —and will again see better days) before booking.  We do not want you to ding us on the review because the neighborhood was not to your expectations.

ABOUT SOUTH SHORE
There must be something in the water that fosters brilliance in this southern lakefront community. First Lady Michelle Obama, business magnate Larry Ellison, Nobel Prize winner James D. Watson and rapper Kanye West are all former residents of South Shore. In addition to its homegrown celebrities, the neighborhood boasts architectural spectacles, one of the city's largest beaches and the South Shore Cultural Center, a crown jewel in Chicago's arts and culture community.  

As the neighborhood's main attraction, the South Shore Cultural Center features an impressive array of galleries, dance studios and public beaches. A longstanding symbol of community pride, it was the sight of President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle's wedding reception and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The building also boasts a nine-hole golf course and the Paul Roberson Theatre, a 600-seat space that hosts the South Shore Opera Company.

The neighborhood's most striking area is the Jackson Park Highlands. This residential pocket features a hodgepodge of architectural styles and imposing mansions, which when combined with a pit stop at nearby Rainbow Beach, make for one of the most charming neighborhood strolls in Chicago.

Walking
Many of the city’s top attractions are a short walk or ride away from each other. Weather-permitting, walking is the best way to see the city and the hidden treasures of architecture and public art in the downtown area.
When planning your route, keep in mind that every 8 blocks equals 1 mile.

Chicago Public Transportation (CTA)
The buses and trains of the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) are a fast and cost-effective way to get into and around the city. Known as the “L” (though they may be elevated or underground) the trains are a fun way to see The Loop from a new vantage point.
CTA visitor passes offer the best value, with unlimited rides on all CTA trains and buses. A 1-day pass is $10, a 3-day pass is $20, and a 7-day pass is $28.
Passes are easy to use. They activate the first time you use them and are valid for the number of consecutive days purchased. Just dip your pass into the bus fare machine or the train station turnstile.
Check the CTA website for the latest fares, travel alerts, and trip planners.

Taxis
Taxis are abundant throughout most of Chicago so finding a cab is typically easy. Taxi rates depend on gas prices and number of passengers and can get a bit pricey but provide a fast and convenient way to get around the city, particularly beyond downtown.

Biking
If time and weather permit, consider renting a bike. Chicago’s lakefront boasts 26 uninterrupted miles of easy bike and walking trails.
Half-day rentals are available from Bike and Roll at Navy Pier and Millennium Park.


From the Airports

O’Hare International Airport: 
Chicago’s O’Hare is one of the world’s busiest airports. It’s about 15 miles northwest of the Loop in downtown Chicago. O’Hare has 5 terminals, all of which have information booths and multilingual employees to assist you.

Midway International Airport:
Although it’s smaller than O’Hare, Midway is closer to the Loop and services more discount airlines (but fewer airlines overall). If you’re looking for a good deal on plane tickets, check out flights to Midway.

NOTES: 
(1) REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY (see below)
(2) The host typically would like to greet the guests in person, occasionally this may not be possible.  In the latter case, please contact the host for the procedure of ""Self Check-in"". 
(3) Let the host know if you plan to drive so the parking matter can be addressed if needed.

REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY
Guests choose a place to stay based what it serves them the best.  We would like to highlight a few items worth considering and invite you to book this place.
(a) We run a very efficient operation and have a very competitive room rate with high quality rooms and services;
(b) This house has an exceptional great location.  It is about 10 minutes to a Green Line Station by walking (hence very close to downtown Chicago) and has convenient access to west, north west, and south west of greater Chicagoland by car.
(c) Free parking is provided.  Parking can be very very expensive in any larger metropolitan, including downtown Chicago.  Therefore it is much more economical to park here and take the train to downtown Chicago. If you rent a room in or near downtown Chicago, you implicitly or explicitly spend a lot of money just on parking.
(d) The ""Occupancy Tax"" is about 11% here which is much less than 23% or higher (doubled) in Chicago. The occupancy tax is paid by the guests based on the sum of room rate and cleaning fee.  With this tax and parking cost in mind, it is much more economical (and without losing convenient access to downtown Chicago) to stay in a convenient suburbs rather than in Chicago or downtown Chicago. Since the ""Occupancy Tax"" is waived if you stay 31 days or longer, you can avoid this tax and save quite a bit of money if you plan your trip ahead and check with the host for room availability.

====== Other Information  ========
Cereal, waffles and coffee are provided by the host for the ARRIVAL day/night of the guests. A full service restaurant (Blue Max Cafe) is only a block north of the house (serves breakfast and lunch only). Various fast food and slow food restaurants are also very close.  A great oriental message service is just couple blocks south of the house (not too expensive, please get coupon from the host for one-time discount).

The house is the middle of Oak Park and Forest Park downtown (almost equal distance).  You have access to 24 hours super markets, and all sorts of other stores and entertainment in both downtown, plus big Chicago downtown of course. Come to stay in the house, and enjoy both the big Chicago, and friendly cute downtown in both Oak Park and Forest Park.",,,,,"NOTES:

I plan to be available most of the time, as we live in the other unit, and can assist with suggestions, directions, etc.  I love meeting my guests, but it is up to you how much interaction you would like to have.

I've been in Logan Square since 1987 and have seen it transform into a wonderful, vibrant community.  The Summer Sunday Farmer's  Market, Logan Theatre, the 606 trail, and ever-growing list of fabulous restaurants and coffee shops make it an ideal place to set up your base camp for exploring Chicago.  And our transit system is there to take you to anywhere you want to explore.

We are conveniently located a block from the public CTA bus that can take you to the Red/Brown Train lines (goes to downtown, Wrigley Field, etc).  And a short walk to the Blue Train line which goes to the O'Hare International airport or downtown.  From these, you can get to almost ANYWHERE you want to go in Chicago!

No parties!","- Outdoor/open window Quiet hours 11 p.m. Specifically to be considerate to my neighbors :)
- No hair or grease/oils/dressing down the sinks
- use coasters for drinks on wood

Welcome to your open, comforting 3-bed apartment in Avondale. 

Find out why the iconic Lonely Planet’s travel guide named Avondale one of the countries most up and coming neighborhoods! Our guests stay with us because:

-You are near the Blue Line train stop and 1 block from the Metra Station
-The quiet tree-lined street
-NEW upgraded finishes
-Delicious & authentic restaurants in the neighborhood 
-Bustling nightlife just a few minutes away
-Our giving, helpful service! :)

(Pssst... Quick favor if you're thinking about booking: Please read the entire listing as it likely answers any questions you may have. Thanks!)

Newly rehabbed, this unit is spacious and perfect for a social experience with a group (yet private with the locations of the bedrooms), or a nice family weekend to enjoy the neighborhood and beautiful Chicago in the summertime!

Step inside and make yourself at home! Enjoy 3 beautiful, comfy bedrooms with queen beds in each and another huge, queen-sized pull out sofa in the living room accommodating a large group with ease. Alongside the living room is our favorite part of the apartment: the dining room! Settle into the 6-person dining table set and enjoy a delicious meal with your group :)

We also thought about the little things that matter for you: Coffee machines stocked for your pleasure, in-home washer & dryer prepared with detergent and dryer sheets are freely accessible, stainless steel kitchen appliances prepared for your use, and plenty of dining and work space. 

The bathrooms are stocked with amenities, including shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and plenty of fresh towels. Kitchen is stocked with all the necessary utensils and is ready for your cooking.

Q: Is the neighborhood safe?
A: Very much so. 24 hours a day.

Q: Do I need to bring towels, a hair dryer, or linens?
A: Nope! we provide all these things. Same with hotel-size toiletries (unless I happen to be out, which is rare).

Q: When can I check in or check out? 
A: Check in is 4pm and check out is 10am. Early check ins can be difficult if there are guests who checked out same day. We ask for an early check-in, or a late-check out fee, if you request either.

Q: Is there parking?
A: There is ample street parking.

Q: Will I have a key? Can I come and go as I please?
A: Yes and yes. And we wouldn't trust any listing with which this isn't the case.

Q: Is the place professionally cleaned between guests?
A: Yes, and we take pride in providing a clean home for guests.

Q: What's my total booking price? 
A: We honestly have no idea. With fees included, it only shows the guest how much they pay. This figure should be present after you enter your dates. Note that, pricing varies on a daily basis, and it actually uses some crazy algorithm to adjust it automatically, so I don't actually control this.

Q: Are the beds comfortable?
A: Very. Some guests say they're the best they've ever slept on!

The entire place is yours to enjoy!

All of the relevant information is available in your check-in doc, which you will receive within a week of your stay. That said, we are always here to help!

Described by the iconic Lonely Planet’s travel guide as the nation’s hottest, need-to-visit ‘hoods”, welcome to Avondale! You’re located on a quiet, tree-lined street but near famous Milwaukee Ave., full of nightlife, delectable restaurants and eclectic shops. Hip neighborhoods like Logan Square and Wicker Park are a short distance away and easily accessible.

Here are a few gems around the area:

-BYOB and enjoy some delicious tacos on L’Patron’s patio and a delicious twist on their fresh guacamole

-Get out and play some bocce ball or lounge under an umbrella at Logan Square’s newest patio bar - Park & Field

-Being a hub for the Chicago Polish community, you’re bound to smell some delicious Kielbasa from the many Polish restaurants on Milwaukee Ave., yum!

Getting around is easy when you’re conveniently located near everything! The Metra train stop is just a block away giving you access to O’Hare airport or straight downtown. If you’re driving, the expressway is a few minutes away.

Parking on the street in front of our house is free, but it can be kind of tough to find a spot later in the evening. Most of the surrounding areas are permit parking only from 6pm-6am, so please be mindful of signs if you want to avoid getting costly tickets!

We’ve made getting in and out a breeze. There are keyless locks to enter the building and the unit. The code will be provided to you before check-in.

Complimentary Smoking Fee, $500
Early check in or late check out, $50 / hour. $25 / hr if you let us know in advance.","• PLEASE NOTE THAT WE CHARGE PER GUEST AFTER A SET NUMBER. PLEASE PROVIDE THE ENTIRE GROUP COUNT IN YOUR RESERVATION REQUEST. IF AN UPDATE TO THE GROUP COUNT IS NEEDED AFTER CONFIRMING THE RESERVATION, THE RESERVATION COST MAY INCREASE.
- Quiet hours between 10pm - 7am

We're happy to give you suggestions on how to get around Chicago or where to eat.

We are a short walk to Milwaukee where many of the restaurants and bars are located. We are a 12 min walk to the Blue line and if you don't feel like walking, the Diversey bus stop is steps from our door and takes you right there. Koz Park is 3 mins from our house. Parking is on Ridgeway and permits will be located in the unit. Permits last 24 hours, so be sure to change it each day.

Our family (including young child and a 14 year old Pomeranian/Shih Tzu mix) live in the upstairs unit. The two units share a common backdoor/stairwell of the building, but for more privacy you can shut the backdoor to the unit. Or leave it open and enjoy the sun on the back porch! We are available as needed to answer questions or provide tips on the area.

The property is about a 10 minute walk from both the Western and Damen Blue line stops. Great restaurants, shopping, and nightlife are all within walking distance. It is a short bike ride to Logan Square, Lincoln Park, and the lakefront.

8-10 minute walk to the Blue Line. 3 minutes to the Western (49) and North Avenue (72) CTA buses. Divvy bike sharing rack about 5 minutes away - bicycle is our preferred way to get around the city! The famous 606 bike/running trail is 5 minute walk. Parking is free and typically plentiful on a quiet, one-way street in front of the building.

Given that we have a toddler, we have toys, strollers, etc. for toddlers and infants. Please feel free to ask if we have anything that you might like to use while staying with us. We know what it is like to travel with a little one so we'll try and help lighten the load!

Additionally, given that we have a young daughter, no parties are allowed. 

Finally, our 2 flat is over 100 years old but has been updated and maintained wonderfully while still showcasing some of the vintage charm. Huge windows, tall ceilings...and creaky wood floors! We have hosted friends and family several times and no one has complained, but we do want to note that there are some noisy spots in the unit. Additionally, you may hear our daughter running around during the day, but she is in bed early and a great sleeper, so unit should be quiet after 8pm or so.","- Please leave shoes at the front door.

Home located in Logan Square. We are steps from the California Blue Line stop, Palmer Square Park and the hippest restaurants and bars in town.

Our home is a Row House which is a unique building that has a semi-condo and semi-house feel. There are 2.5 bathrooms so you can feel at ease to get ready to go out. On the first floor we share the common area for cooking, eating and hanging out. The bedrooms are on the second floor. Brad is a musician so we usually have music playing while we are home. We have a 4 year old puppy, Macchiato and a 1 year old child. They are very friendly, but CAN be a bit crazy from time to time.

Our street is super quiet, yet located extremely close to all the happening and fun stuff.

We occupy one of the bedrooms in our home and for the most part, we work from home.  Ask us anything about where do and what to do in our neighborhood and around the city.  We also put out a tray of snacks in our kitchen(croissants and fig bars, usually).

Logan Square is a very laid back neighborhood. Super bike friendly and dog friendly. We are steps from tons of restaurants, coffee shops, bars, clubs, the 606 trail and more.

Public Transportation:
CTA Blueline is a 2 minute walk away. We are close to multiple bus stops as well.

By Foot:
We are walking distance to many coffee shops, restaurants and bars.

Biking:
We are a 2 minute walk from a bike rental station. Chicago is super bike friendly and many streets have bike lanes.

Vehicles:

Walk to the lake, Wrigley Field, the red/brown/purple line and a ton of great restaurants, shops and bars.

2 level 1 bedroom loft in East Lakeview. Close to the lake, grocery stories, the cubs, and a billion restaurants and bars. The loop is a quick uber, bus or el ride away.

The place is yours!

I will be out of town during your stay but have my phone glued to me at all times - feel free to text, call or email - no matter the time or situation! I also have a few close friends that will be on call that live very close and stop by if needed.

My street and the ones surrounding it are perfect for grabbing a drink on a patio and dog watching! Wilde Bar has a little of everything. Dry Hop is great if you for beer, cocktails and good food. Yellowtail sushi is amazing and only a few blocks away. I also love to grab some wine, cheese or something from the deli at Marianos - grocery store basically connected to building - and then venture down to the park to eat on a park bench or blanket or by the lake.

I am a fan of lyft and uber but the El and bus makes getting around very easy as well. There is an El stop less than 10 minutes away (walking) that services the red, brown and purple lines. 

You can also sign up for a divvy membership - this allows you to check out the blue bikes you are bound to see on every other corner of the city. You just check one out and then return it to a divvy check-in center once you have made it to your destination. 

If you are planning a longer adventure and need a car for an hour or even a day or two - I would recommend checking out the app “Getaround”.

Tucker the cat will be with you in the apartment! 

Just be careful - the top and bottom locks take different keys. If you lock the bottom lock you can open door from inside but will be locked out from the outside.","Before checking out, please:

"1) The entire property is smoke and vapor free. We have marijuana and tobacco chemical sensors on the property. They know it's not cooking smoke, They react to airborne particulate, not the smell on your clothes. The PolySens® technology works, so exit the building if you want to smoke/vape or you'll be fined $500 and asked to leave.

2) Your reservation has paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number, whether visiting or sleeping, you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first.

3) Quiet hours are 10PM-8AM. Noise should not be heard coming from your apartment. This is a quiet residential building. 95% of our guests have no issues, and never hear from us. We will be sure to send you at least 2 warnings prior to asking anyone to leave, but one way or another, the apartment must be quiet.

4) Parties, events, and commercial activity are not allowed.

5) We reserve the right to ask you to leave without a refund if any of the above rules are broken.

6) Lost keys will incur a $100 charge. We have to change the locks. Please use the app to send a picture of all the keys at check-in AND check-out.

7) We do not accept instant bookings from residents of the Chicago metropolitan area as identified by profile city or phone number area code. If you live near Chicago and would like to book a stay, please send us a message with a little more information about your plans

8) Our favorite restaurant in Chicago is La Scarola.

Privacy Statement on the Use of Security Cameras:
We respect and value the privacy of our guests. We will never place a camera inside a living space. While Airbnb policy allows cameras in spaces that are not used for sleeping or bathing, we disagree. Cameras should be banned from inside all living spaces. Footage should be automatically deleted. Everything should be disclosed in advance. We use hallway security cameras to verify the number of guests who have entered an apartment. This is useful for stopping parties, and under additional prices extra guest charges may apply for extra people sleeping over.  All footage is deleted automatically after a stay, unless there is an open resolution center case. It’s unfortunate that not every guest is honest about their intentions, and our community would not allow us to be on Airbnb if we did not prevent unwanted behaviors. Let us know if you have questions.

We do not accept instant bookings from residents of the Chicago metropolitan area as identified by profile city or phone number area code. If you live near Chicago and would like to book a stay, please send us a message with a little more information about your plans

Immediately after booking, we will send you a few questions about your arrival time, contact info, number of guests/visitors, and to name our favorite restaurant, which is listed at the bottom of the house rules. Guests will not be allowed to check in without providing complete answers","1) The entire property is smoke and vapor free. We have marijuana and tobacco chemical sensors on the property. They know it's not cooking smoke, They react to airborne particulate, not the smell on your clothes. The PolySens® technology works, so exit the building if you want to smoke/vape or you'll be fined $500 and asked to leave.

2) Your reservation has paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number, whether visiting or sleeping, you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first.

3) Quiet hours are 10PM-8AM. Noise should not be heard coming from your apartment. This is a quiet residential building. 95% of our guests have no issues, and never hear from us. We will be sure to send you at least 2 warnings prior to asking anyone to leave, but one way or another, the apartment must be quiet.

4) Parties, events, and commercial activity are not allowed.

5) We reserve the right to ask you to leave without a refund if any of the above rules are broken.

6) Lost keys will incur a $100 charge. We have to change the locks. Please use the app to send a picture of all the keys at check-in AND check-out.

Privacy Statement on the Use of Security Cameras:
We respect and value the privacy of our guests. We will never place a camera inside a living space. While Airbnb policy allows cameras in spaces that are not used for sleeping or bathing, we disagree. Cameras should be banned from inside all living spaces. Footage should be automatically deleted. Everything should be disclosed in advance. We use hallway security cameras to verify the number of guests who have entered an apartment. This is useful for stopping parties, and under additional prices extra guest charges may apply for extra people sleeping over.  All footage is deleted automatically after a stay, unless there is an open resolution center case. It’s unfortunate that not every guest is honest about their intentions, and our community would not allow us to be on Airbnb if we did not prevent unwanted behaviors. Let us know if you have questions. We have nothing to hide.","We love our guests! We are available to our guests! 
We text our guests most of what they need! 
...WE NEED A NUMBER TO REACH YOU AT! 
Please confirm your phone number and email address upon booking.

IF YOU WILL NOT HAVE A US PHONE NUMBER, we ask that you download the Whats App phone texting app. We also have We Chat - please provide your ID!","WICKER PARK!

in Chicago's Logan Square? Stay steps away from culinary greatness in this warm and sun-drenched apartment.

This spacious one-bedroom apartment includes a relatively new Casper queen-sized mattress. The large living room includes a comfortable couch for an additional sleeper, as well as a daybed. 

A block from the California Blue Line stop, you'll be able to shuffle downtown in mere minutes.  The booming Logan Square restaurant and bar scene is a short walk from the front door.  Or, lounge in the sun-filled living room, use the desk and wi-fi to catch up on work, or sip some lemonade on the cute back deck.  

Street parking is almost never a problem, though it is getting trickier in the evening. Also! Portions of the street ARE permit only--keep an eye out. If you'd like to increase your parking options by using daily permits, please let me know. If so, please familiarize yourself with permit use: https://www.chicityclerk.com/city-stickers-parking/about-parking-permits

This classic Chicago apartment will enhance your Chicago experience, as will the paintings and prints by local artists that line the walls.  

The building is charming and well kept, but it is over 100 yrs old. Sometimes the water lightens for a second (though it's never cold), and sometimes, you must open the windows, because the radiators have worked too well (not a bad problem to have).  The living room and the bedroom each have AC window units, though the kitchen can get warm in the summer. The apartment also gets a great breeze, because the backdoor opens onto the top (3rd) floor balcony.  It's true--they don't build them like they used to: you will rarely hear the neighbors. However! Please remove shoes and be careful when dropping bags. The floor does amplify sound to the person below.

The pets will need to stay home (allergies), but children could be discussed. Also, small groups could be discussed. The apartment could--and has--worked well for a friends weekend, etc. There's no smoking in the apartment, but you could smoke on the back deck.

There are many shelves of books that you are welcome to dive into during your stay. If you wanted the opportunity to discover new Chicago writers or catch up on some contemporary fiction, it will be available to you.

The apartment has a full kitchen with everything you need to make meals. A coffee maker and grinder are also provided.  There is a kettle for tea.  

Just a couple blocks from the apartment is Palmer Square Park, and it's a great place to jog or walk --there's a path that circles it.  There's also a small playground, if you do have a child.

This is a third floor apartment—the very top floor. You'll find a little bouquet on the door. 

*Only those with full profiles will be considered.*

You'll have the full apartment!

I'll be available for any questions you might have. Texting is the best way to reach me.

We do ask that you respect our neighbors by keeping noise to a reasonable level.,"Welcome to Chicago! Home of the World Series Champs, the Cubs. Our large 1-bedroom/1-bath condo is just 1 mile from Wrigley Field and is ideal for any Chicago getaway. It features a full kitchen, a private bedroom, and conveniences like a full kitchen and fast WiFi. 

Metered parking is available nearby, but it gets more difficult to park at night. I recommend taking the train for your entire stay. The closest train station is Paulina-Lincoln/Roscoe Station, just a 3-min walk away.

Illuminated by sunny natural light, our studio features Queen-size bed, premium linens, and plenty of closet space so you can unpack and forget about your suitcase for a while. Enjoy the privacy of your own room, with doors that close and independently controlled air-conditioning units.

The apartment includes one full bathroom, with a shower, sink, and toilet. We’re all about helping you look (and smell) your best, so we provide shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in addition to hand soap and fluffy towels. Trust us when we say there’s no better way to warm up after a Windy City walk than a hot shower!

There’s ample space for guests to relax on the sofa and watch on a large flat-screen TV. Like the rest of the unit, you’ll live it up in luxury among hardwood floors and contemporary decor. The entire place has free, fast WiFi and Chicago sunshine streaming in through the windows.

Whether you’re craving a home-cooked meal or just somewhere to put the box of deep-dish, our kitchen is fully stocked with cookware, dishes, utensils, and has swanky granite countertops. Appliances include a full-sized fridge and freezer, gas stove, oven, microwave, toaster, and coffee maker. The only things missing are your favorite farmer’s market finds!!

Please make yourself at home in this gorgeous apartment; our place is yours and only yours during your stay. We do ask that you respect our neighbors by keeping noise to a reasonable level.

Just west of Chicago’s hip Lake View neighborhood and steps from the Paulina-Lincoln/Roscoe L Station, our residential location is the perfect place to relax and recharge on any trip to vibrant Chicago.

Here you’ll find cozy restaurants, low-key bars, eclectic boutiques, and all the essentials for a comfortable stay. There’s a Target just 5 minutes away on foot (home of things you never knew you needed), several banks, a Whole Foods Market, and a variety of exercise options including a YMCA, Pure Barre, and Core Power Yoga all within a couple of blocks.

If you’re coming to town for a Cubs game, there’s no need pack into the train like sardines with hundreds of other Cubs fans - we’re just 1 mile from Wrigley Field, and walking is a nice way to stretch your legs before or after a game.

But that’s not the only attraction (besides Target) that’s accessible on foot from our place; you’ll find a plethora of fantastic places to eat and drink just minutes away. Don’t miss the exquisite pastries from Loba Pastry + Coffee or the German delicacies from Dinkel's Bakery - both excellent ways to start the day.

In the mood for tacos? Head to Cafe El Tapatio for authentic Mexican eats. Or dig into some spicy curry or noodles at Thai Thank You (pro tip: it’s BYOB). And pizza never disappoints, especially when it’s from Pizzeria Serio. Wash it all down with a cold treat from Scooter's Frozen Custard or Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams, and you’ve got a memorable eating experience.


When you’re searching for souvenirs or some retail therapy, walk over to Southport Avenue, where you’ll find shops selling everything from cosmetics to beer to sneakers. Only brought a carry on? Maybe skip the shops and head to Southport Lanes & Billiards, where you can play old-school billiards and try your hand at bowling. Or, if you’re up for a walk, take the Brown line to Belmont Station and walk 15 minutes to the Lakefront Trail for stunning views of Lake Michigan.

Why splurge on an expensive rental car when you can take advantage of Chicago’s great public transportation system? Our place is just a 3-minute walk from Paulina-Lincoln/Roscoe Station, where you can catch the Brown Line train. The Brown Line will take you south to Downtown Chicago in just about 15 minutes, or you can head north to Uptown or Evanston when you transfer to the Red Line at Belmont Station.

Flying into Chicago? We’re a 20-minute drive from O’Hare when there is no traffic, but if there is traffic you may be better off taking public transit (and saving some $$ on the taxi or Uber fare). Take the Blue Line from O’Hare to Belmont & Kimball, then transfer to the #77 bus and ride for about 15 minutes to Belmont & Paulina.

In addition to public transit, ridesharing (Uber or Lyft) is also a great way to get around the Chicago metro. When you’re heading out with a group or want that extra little bit of luxury, just request a ride - they’re readily available and can take you anywhere you want to go.

What you get?  Hotel quality beds, TV, full kitchen, full patio and grill, 7 beds, Full House to yourself, Ez ""Self Checking"", Centered location, personal recommendations, and an easy to use guidebook an instructions once you book. We have all the towels, kitchen utensils needed for a long term stay. We even have some baby friendly amenities if requested. We also added a SNES classic with 30 games, and by March we will have the place full of Chicago Trivia and Facts, and more themed rooms!

Layout: We have 7 Beds in this unit. One room has a top of the line GreenTea Memory foam King mattress, with a nart deco theme. Another room has two queen size beds and a comfy memory foam pullout as well. Living room has couch plus 2 memory foam pullouts via the daybed in the living room. And an extra pullout if needed. :) 

Location: We are located in West Lakeview, which is a centered location, and pretty much 10 minutes away from anything  you want in the city. We are 5 minutes from Wrigley. 10 second walk from the best Cuban in town. And we have all the food shopping you could want in walking distance. Perfect for families and long stays. :) Also this location is VERY safe. A lot of schools, people walking dogs, and a very charming neighborhood vibe if that is important to you.

Parking: Don't be fooled, Chicago is AMAZING, no doubt about that. But because of that parking can be a nightmare, with up to $60 a day parking. Luckily we have one of the best blocks in the city, because our block is FREE to park on. So you even with 2-3 cars, they can all park safely and easily. :) 

This place goes fast! We won't be beat, found a comparable place with a good location and amount of beds? Maybe I can try and price match for you. Want to stay over 7 days, shoot me a message, I'll see what I can do. :D

The Pictures should do most the talking, but again.

Again, very safe, very family friendly. And plenty to walk to. It's Lakeview, pretty much centered. :)

I recommend Uber/lyft to all my guests. reason being, the train/bus cost $2.50-$3.00 per person. Which is pretty much the same you'd pay with Lyft. And on top of that, you'll save precious hours, which is the most important thing on this trip, because who know's when you'll be back to this amazing city.

Due note like all apartments, you'll probably hear some slight noise above during day hours. 

The no Party rule, helps me keep booking amazing 5 star guests and families, and helps the other 5 star guests and families feel safe that others in the neighboring units are highly qualified guests. :)

Clean towels, sheets and shampoo/conditioner. Washer and dryer. HBO go, Roku box, Netflix and a variety of movies and books. 

Extra charges for the following:

Flat fee of $25 for pets (no more than 2 please)

Flat fee of $25 if you would like to check in before 3pm… If you want to come in like 30 mins earlier and if I am able to accommodate you, I will (no charge)

Flat fee of $25 If you want to stay later. I ask people “check out"" by 11am, if you plan on staying later you are welcome to stay till 3pm for the extra fee, but this needs to be arranged before hand. Please do not ask to stay later the morning of check out, its just not cool.

Flat fee of $10 if you would like leave bags after you have “checked out"" of my place. So if you have a later flight and want to continue exploring city without the hassle of pulling your suitcase around, you are welcome to. But this needs to be arranged before hand. 

I am more than willing to accommodate you, so long as you communicate what is needed prior to arrival.

I make an effort to meet as many of my guests as I possibly can before handing over keys, but sometimes scheduling can be hectic, so if I'm unable to meet guests I will give  thorough instructions for arrival/departure. My main concern is that my guests arrive safely.

This is one of the coolest neighborhoods in Chicago. Historically a very popular tourist destination, the Uptown Square at the center of the Uptown Entertainment District which is home to various music venues, nightclubs, restaurants and shops. The Uptown Entertainment District is now experiencing a revival, with new restaurants and shops opening every year. Uptown is also a stop for Chicago Gangster tours, with many locations tied to infamous gangsters such as John Dillinger, Al Capone, Machine Gun Jack McGurn, Roger Touhy (""Terrible Touhy"") and others.

I am 2 blocks from the redline. I would advise against renting a car if you are visiting, there is just no reason. Train and most buses run 24 hours a day 7 days a week. If you do drive, street parking here is easy and free. Also my place is about a 10-15 minute walk to the lake and there are more divvy bikes stations than you can shake a stick at, but why would you shake a stick at a bike station; that's dumb.

No smoking. You wouldn't think I would need to write this but I guess it needs to be said, so no smoking or you will not get your security deposit back.

I'm available for questions 24/7 via phone but I tend to lead a pretty active lifestyle, the result of which is I'm not home much.  

I'm also a big coffee (though come summer it is mostly iced coffee) and matcha drinker and will be happy to make a cup or two for you if you let me know the night prior.

See the note in ""The Space"" section regarding how I may have to delegate some issues you encounter to my siblings or pals.

Bucktown/Wicker Park is a pretty happening spot.  All spots listed are less than a ten minute walk from the apartment unless otherwise noted:

For food and drink many of Eater's 38 essential restaurants are within walking distance and there are countless others that get lots of food press love (Paul Kahan's Big Star/Dove's Luncheonette/Cafe Cancale, Pub Royale, Piece Brewery and Pizzeria, Antique Taco, Stan's Doughnuts, The Delta, Small Cheval, Umami Burger, Le Bouchon, Craft Pizza, Furious Spoon, The Bristol).  

Beloved cocktail bar The Violet Hour is a short stumble away and iconic Chicago beer bar The Map Room is five minutes out by Divvy bike.  Stop by the Emporium Arcade Bar for a quality draft list and quality gaming.  For coffee check out the The Wormhole, Ipsento,  and La Colombe (The Wormhole has an entire Delorean inside of its relaxed environs and seriously impressive latte art).

Music venues within a five minute walk include The Subterranean and The Double Door.

Shop at the numerous stores on Damen and Milwaukee ranging for international brands to fun, independent boutiques.

Also, you are one block away from the newest Bucktown attraction, The 606.  The 606 is a 2.7 mile, $95 million trail/park that runs on an old freight track.  There are many places to sit and enjoy as well as numerous parks at entryways to the trails.  It's a great place to bike and walk even in winter.

There is free street parking that is well-lit, safe, and all around the apartment (I've never had to park more than two blocks away).  There is a Divvy bike-share station on the corner (Divvy is my primary form of transportation), the # 72 bus runs every ten minutes, the CTA's Blue Line is a five minute walk away, the Metra commuter rail is a 10 minute walk ), and there are cabs on North Avenue throughout the day (Uber/Lyft users can expect to have a car at the doorstep within five minutes 24 hours a day).  The apartment's close proximity to the highway means most fares to River North, Millennium Park or the Art Institute will run less than $15 on via ridesharing outside of rush hour traffic.

There is permitted street parking that is well-lit, safe, and generally close to the apartment.  There is a Divvy bike-share stations one, four, and six blocks away (Divvy is my primary form of transportation), the # 72 bus to Red Line trains runs every ten minutes just down the street on North Avenue, the CTA's Damen stop for Blue Line trains is a five minute walk away, the Metra commuter rail is a 10 minute walk, and there are cabs on North Avenue throughout the day (Uber/Lyft users can expect to have a car at the doorstep within five minutes 24 hours a day).  Download the Transit app to see the cost, directions, and time commitment for all the different modes of transit in one place.

I have a very early checkout to allow myself the time necessary to turn the room around and get to work on-time.  I'm totally flexible if there are no other guests arriving the day of your departure, and stashing bags in the living room (no matter if you're arriving early or departing late) is not a problem in the slightest.","Please try to pick up after yourselves by placing cups and dishes in the sink so I can clean them.   If you plan on bringing friends old or new by, that's a-okay if you ask in advance.  Smokers please use the patio. Leave the keys on the table where you found them on the way out (don't worry about bolting the door).  Please leave the door to your room slightly ajar when you're not around to let the airflow in and so I know I do not have to tiptoe around to avoid disturbing you.","I'm available for questions 24/7 via phone but I tend to lead a pretty active lifestyle, the result of which is I'm not home much.

8. Use the cover provided when using the microwave.

9. Lost key fee is $150 per key.  Lock out fee for exterior OR interior doors is $150 (that is if you leave your key in the unit and need to call me to let you back in). I do not have keys for interior doors that are locked.

10. At checkout, please hang all dirty towels on the over-the-door hooks in the bathrooms.

11. If more guests sleep at a location than the number originally stated in the booking, the security deposit will be charged in full.

12. If guests check out late, this delays the cleaners from beginning their cleaning at the predetermined check-out time so guests will be charged $50. Guests who are still in the apartment after 12 pm will be charged for an extra night. This does not apply if we have approved a late checkout in advance.

13.  Please make sure to turn off the A/C or lower the heat setting to 60 degrees when you are leaving the unit (both to go out temporarily or for the final checkout) to help save energy and high utility bills.

14.  Please use coasters and placemats provided and wipe up spills promptly so as to not cause water marks and stains on wood tables.

Being native locals, we can help you live like a local while you're here with recommendations for eats in Wicker Park (or elsewhere in the city), how to get around the city and things to do in Chicago.

You'll be minutes from I-90/94. Or if you prefer public transportation, you can take a 7-minute walk to the CTA Blue Line Damen stop to take you downtown in 10 minutes or take you to O'Hare Airport, or you can take one of several different buses.

In short, you'll be close to everything...without the noise!

Two other occupied apartments are in the building so please be mindful of quiet hours (10pm-8am weekdays, 11pm-9am weekends). If you know you'll be unable to respect the quiet hours, then this apartment is not for you.

1.  Please be respectful of upstairs neighbors.  Quiet hours are from 10pm-8am (weekdays) and 11pm-9am (weekends). Any noise complaints will result in a $50 charge.

2. If the apartment is left in an exceptionally messy state, we will charge $50 for every extra hour of cleaning required.

3. There is absolutely NO SMOKING in the apartment.  Any smoking outside should be outside the black gates. Breaking this rule will incur a $300 fine.

4. Breaking anything in the apartment will mean that I will bill you for the damages.

5. Please put things back where they belong.  Clean up after yourself especially by putting garbage in garbage cans.

6. No glassware is allowed on the outside back deck.

The place is comfortable, tidy, and efficiently located on North Avenue in the heart of ultra-hip Wicker Park; Steps away from a thriving area full of popular restaurants, cafes, boutiques, concert venues, nightlife, etc.. There are convenient public transportation and Uber options to get all over the city, quickly and easily, from here also.

It is an expansive, high ceiling, three bedroom apartment, on the third floor of a building with a comedy bar below [Northbar  http://www.liveatnorthbar.com] - which often has hilarious performances. Everything you need for a comfortable stay is provided - full size beds, pillows, blankets, towels, toiletries, hair dryer, kitchen, washer & dryer, and tv & wifi are all accessible to enhance your stay.

The entire place, except for the other two bedrooms (because they MAY be occupied with other Airbnb guests), is available for your stay. However, please sleep in your bedroom (and not in the common areas).

I do not live at the apartment, yet I am nearby and available throughout your stay to recommend local attractions, dining, nightlife, and also answer questions that you may have.

“Wicker Park is famous for live music and nightlife, chef-driven restaurants and countless art galleries — many housed within the Flat Iron Arts Building. If you have an acute knowledge of craft cocktails or an affinity for coffee, plus want to sift through records or thrifted threads, there's no better area to sip and shop in the country.

The area has become a prevailing influence on Chicago's Michelin-rated, James Beard Award-winning dining scene, boasting some of the city's most sought after tables. Wicker Park and Bucktown are also known for their palate pleasing nightcaps, like renowned brewery Piece and mixology tour de force The Violet Hour.

Along North, Division, Milwaukee and Damen Avenues, you will find an unbelievable blend of vintage shops amid independently-owned boutiques touting fashions for both men and women, and luxury home goods and beauty products.

The area has become a prevailing influence on Chicago's Michelin-rated, James Beard Award-winning dining scene, boasting some of the city's most sought after tables. Wicker Park and Bucktown are also known for their palate pleasing nightcaps, like renowned brewery Piece and mixology tour de force The Violet Hour.

No Smoking
The home (and entire building including outdoor common areas) is designated as a strictly smoke-free community. There will be a $500 fee imposed if you choose to smoke in the building. Please respect our policy and step outside the vicinity.

The perfect location for a weekend getaway or business trip. River North is a stylish urban neighborhood that borders the Magnificent Mile and is just across the bridge from the Loop, Millennium Park, and the downtown theater district. It is the go-to neighborhood for those who appreciate fine art and design, but is also a little quieter than being right in the middle of downtown. For those who appreciate fine dining and drinks, you can find everything from knockout noodles and Spanish small plates to high-end steakhouses and famed pizzerias. Just about every type of cuisine is covered in this mix of award-winning restaurants and local favorites. And for a fun evening out, slip into any of the sleek new clubs, upscale wine bars and craft cocktail lounges, many of which are walking distance from the home.

NOTES: 
(1) REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY (see below)
(2) The host typically would like to greet the guests in person, occasionally this may not be possible.  In the latter case, please contact the host for the procedure of ""Self Check-in"". 
(3) Let the host know if you plan to drive so the parking matter can be addressed if needed.

REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY
Guests choose a place to stay based what it serves them the best.  We would like to highlight a few items worth considering and invite you to book this place.
(a) We run a very efficient operation and have a very competitive room rate with high quality rooms and services;
(b) This house has an exceptional great location.  It is about 10 minutes to a Green Line Station by walking (hence very close to downtown Chicago) and has convenient access to west, north west, and south west of greater Chicagoland by car.
(c) Free parking is provided.  Parking can be very very expensive in any larger metropolitan, including downtown Chicago.  Therefore it is much more economical to park here and take the train to downtown Chicago. If you rent a room in or near downtown Chicago, you implicitly or explicitly spend a lot of money just on parking.
(d) The ""Occupancy Tax"" is about 11% here which is much less than 23% or higher (doubled) in Chicago. The occupancy tax is paid by the guests based on the sum of room rate and cleaning fee.  With this tax and parking cost in mind, it is much more economical (and without losing convenient access to downtown Chicago) to stay in a convenient suburbs rather than in Chicago or downtown Chicago. Since the ""Occupancy Tax"" is waived if you stay 31 days or longer, you can avoid this tax and save quite a bit of money if you plan your trip ahead and check with the host for room availability.

====== Other Information  ========
Cereal, waffles and coffee are provided by the host for the ARRIVAL day/night of the guests. A full service restaurant (Blue Max Cafe) is only a block north of the house (serves breakfast and lunch only). Various fast food and slow food restaurants are also very close.  A great oriental message service is just couple blocks south of the house (not too expensive, please get coupon from the host for one-time discount).

The house is the middle of Oak Park and Forest Park downtown (almost equal distance).  You have access to 24 hours super markets, and all sorts of other stores and entertainment in both downtown, plus big Chicago downtown of course. Come to stay in the house, and enjoy both the big Chicago, and friendly cute downtown in both Oak Park and Forest Park.",,,,,"NOTES:

Experience Kenwood, one of the City's loveliest neighborhoods with tree-lined streets and beautiful single family homes. We are very close to Lake Michigan and the City's museums. The University of Chicago is nearby as are restaurants and shops.

Walk two blocks to the stop for express buses that carry passengers to Chicago's downtown or three blocks to an electric train that speeds it way to the Chicago Loop. Density in Kenwood is low, therefore, street parking is plentiful.","If you order out or bring in food, please eat at either the dining room, kitchen table or weather permitting, balcony. Sorry, there are no cooking privileges other than making tea or coffee in the morning and enjoying toast, English muffin or banana bread, when I've made it, for breakfast. You always may help yourself to water and ice from the refrigerator door.

An incredibly popular neighborhood destination, largely because of its close proximity to the lake and downtown, Old Town keeps up a lively pace day and night. Victorian-era buildings, brick alleyways and narrow, tree-lined streets are charming backdrops to a busy main strip that runs along Wells Street between North Avenue and Division Street.

Uber is extremely efficient, but the CTA Red, Purple & Brown 'L' Train or numerous CTA Bus Stops are a 5-minute walk.

Street Parking is Permit Only.  Permits can be provided at no charge.  Covered garage parking available for $10 per night.

Unit is located on the 3rd Floor (essentially 2nd, as the 1st Floor are garden units). There is no elevator, so it may not be suitable for people who cannot climb stairs.  Non-ADA Accessible. Our family also includes a very friendly and hypoallergenic dog.

Check-In Rules:
Unfortunately, I will not always be able to personally meet all guests at their desired check in time.

If I'm unable to meet you, I'll provide the Digital Door Lock Code with very detailed instructions for entry which will be messaged through Airbnb messenger at your Check-In time. You'll be given instant access to the building whenever you arrive! Please TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF upon entering the home. 

Food and Beverages:
There is absolutely NO consumption of food or beverages (excluding water) outside of the kitchen, kitchen bar, and dining room.

All food and beverages in the fridge and kitchen cabinets belong to other guests and your host. Refrain from taking food/beverages that were not brought in or purchased by you. Coffee, creamer, and sugar on the coffee bar in the kitchen are complimentary and you may have as much of it as you'd like. 

Guest Policy:
""Guest"" constitutes any person entering the property, whether spending the night or only visiting. Unverified, unauthorized guests are not allowed on the premises. If you'd like to have a guest during your stay, your guest MUST be verified and announced through the AirBnb messenger and approval of this guest must be explicitly given by us, the hosts. Violation of this rule will result in immediate cancellation of your reservation and termination of your stay. 

Mail:
Please notify the host if you want to have Mail/Parcels shipped to you during your stay.

Quiet Hours:
Quiet Hours at the residence are between the hours of 10pm and 7am Sunday-Thursday and 12am and 7am on Friday-Saturday.

This is a Shared Space with many Travelers all visiting Chicago for a different purpose.  Having common courtesy is more than enough to fulfill this rule.  If you're a Late Night personality, please respect those waking up early for work.  If you're up at the crack of dawn, please get ready as quietly as possible as to not disturb those still asleep.

Smoking:
There is absolutely no smoking inside of the building.  This includes Electronic Cigarettes and all other forms of Tobacco.

Travelers are more than welcome to Smoke outside of the building.  


Weapons:
Absolutely NO WEAPONS of any sort are allowed inside of the building.  This includes Firearms, Knives, and anything else that can be used in a malicious manner.  Host(s) will have Final Say in what constitutes as a weapon.

Violence:
There will be no violence of any sort tolerated inside of the building.  This includes Physical Violence, Verbal (Arguing, Threats, Intimidation, etc.), and any sort of behavior that causes another person in the house to feel upset. 

‘Common Sense’ Rule:
As this is a Shared Building, guests are expected to act in a way which is both Respectful and Inviting to everyone else sharing the space.

Jefferson Park is known as ""The Gateway to Chicago."" It has long been thought of as a transportation hub connecting the Northwest Suburbs to the City. People who want the convenience of suburban parking lots and availability of chain stores will be able to find what they need in the nearby suburbs. Those who want to spend their time downtown and use public transportation will also have great options. For those who want a little of both, it is ideal. The neighborhood itself is a quiet community of mostly long-term Chicago residents. Local shopping and restaurants are available within easy walking distance. 

There are also nearby forest preserves with trails for running, walking, or bike riding. If you look closely you may find a family of deer! There are also three public parks within a 2 mile radius. Two of the parks have free public pools. Please ask if you would like to see the schedules.

occupies the entire third floor, which includes 3 bedrooms, a bathroom, full kitchen and ballroom. There is an additional bedroom on the second floor that can be included with an extra rental fee. 

(Upon availability, bedrooms can be booked singularly, for one or two guests. In that case, the bathroom and kitchen might be shared with other guests.  If the second floor bedroom is rented singularly, there is no kitchen access.)

There is a separate entrance and guests take the back staircase to the third floor. The third floor area is totally private and the host does not use nor access this space while you are a guest.

Bicycles (two adult, one child and a Tandem) and (2) beach passes are available for your enjoyment.

Guests can use other parts of the house or garden for small events or private get togethers. For instance, enjoy high tea, cocktails or wine and cheese on the outside terrace or have a private dinner catered in the grand dining room. Gardens can be used for anything from a formal wedding to a casual barbecue. Please inquire for rates and options available.

*There is no access to the first and second floor, unless they have been rented separately for an event or added experience.","Stay in the Guest Suite of this exquisitely restored Historic Landmark Manor House, one block to Lake Michigan's beaches and close to town and NU. Enjoy the entire third floor, which includes three bedrooms, a private bath with claw-foot soaking tub and shower, private kitchen with full amenities, and a ballroom, in case you feel like dancing! The ballroom can be equipped with a couch and air mattress for any extra guests. Also available is an additional second floor bedroom for a sixth guest.

The Guest Suite is situated in a beautiful historic Manor House built in 1914 and designed by famed architect Earnest Mayo. The entire house was restored to its original splendor and has since won several awards and been seen on TV and in movies. The house is both a National and Evanston landmark and is situated in the Lakeshore Historic District. The guest suite occupies the entire restored third floor (apx 2500 sq ft), which includes three bedrooms, a bathroom, full kitchen and a ballroom. 

There is also a single bedroom on the second floor that can be used for an extra guest. Please inquire regarding fees.

The house and gardens can also be rented for private parties and small gatherings. Please inquire for details and pricing. Additional documentation in the form of an agreement regarding pricing and rules for use of the space will require signature, if interested.

The host respects the privacy of their guests and therefore, is fairly hands-off. However, any special requests can be made in advance or upon arrival and we are always only a text away with any questions or desires you may have 24/7.

We are located in the heart of Evanston's Lakeshore Historic district, only one block to the best beaches, with all that the lakefront has to offer; including boat and paddle board rentals, tennis, fitness trail, running/cycling paths and concessions. We are a short walk to NU and town, which includes grocery, coffee shops, restaurants, movie theatre, antique and boutique shops and other attractions.

We are in a very walkable neighborhood and bicycles are available, as well. Evanston also has public Divvy bikes to rent. If venturing to downtown Chicago for a meeting or sightseeing, you can use either the el train/CTA (like a subway but elevated) or Metra train. The stop for either is a short walk. There is also a CTA bus to the mall. Car rentals, taxi's and Uber are also readily available. If coming from the airport, the easiest method is Uber and more cost effective than a taxi. However, the most inexpensive is the el train.

License #","Smoking is not allowed in, on or within 25 feet of the property. This is out of respect to our neighbors.

You are limited to the number of guests listed in your reservation (max 5 without an additional guest charge). There is a maximum of 4 extra guests allowed with an extra fee. Only registered guests may enter the property, without prior consent of the host.

Check- in is with the host between 3:00 - 5:00PM. We can usually accommodate earlier or later check in. Please arrange this with your host after booking. If there are multiple people in your party, please note that the host will only greet the people that arrive during check-in time. After that, your first arrival will have to greet your remaining party members who arrive past the check-in time. We can accommodate previous guests who have stayed before with lock box check-in for arrivals at or after the check-in time.

There is a $200 fee for any lost key or key that is not returned prior to check out.

Each guest is provided with a set of towels for use during their stay. Towels must be left onsite upon departure. There is a replacement fee for any towels not returned prior to check out. 

Any damaged or missing items will incur a replacement fee after check out.

By booking, the guests agree to the house rules and agree to read the house manual and follow all rules therein. The guests understand that if any rules are not adhered to that they may be asked to leave immediately and will not receive a refund for any part of their booking.

Guests renting additional rooms or space in the house or gardens will be provided with documentation in the form of an agreement regarding details, pricing and additional rules for use of that space. The above rules apply for rentals of any kind.

Please text us with any needs, questions or emergencies that occur before or after arrival.

The room available is actually the entire second floor of a house, best for groups or those who require a large space for themselves! The first floor has a living room, kitchen, and bathroom. The basement has a clothing washer/dryer.

Located in a nice neighborhood not far from downtown Chicago and airports. This is NOT a hotel. The experience you will have here reflects my suburban Chicago home!

MUST BE DOG-FRIENDLY! The host and his canine companion reside on the first floor of the house.

The space available is on the second floor of the house. Included is access to a personal heater, air conditioner, and pedestal fan for keeping your space comfortable and climate controlled to your liking. The first floor has a common living room with couch and TV, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a private bedroom that the host uses. There are newly finished hardwood floors throughout all the rooms, with tile in the bathroom and kitchen. The basement has a clothing washer and dryer, but there is also a very nice laundromat across the street! Out in the backyard is a patio and grill.

A smaller second bedroom on the first floor of the house is also listed on AirBnB, therefore there may be another group of guests in the house at the same time.

Guests can access the first floor kitchen, bathroom, and living-room, as well as the clothing washer and dryer in the basement.

The host resides on the first floor of the house, but physical availability will depend on the day. Socialization, questions, or concerns will be best through text messaging.

Berwyn is a quiet family suburb right outside of Chicago. The infamous historic route 66 that connects Chicago to California runs through (known as Ogden avenue). It's located between O'Hare and Midway international airport, making both relatively easy to access!

Common near-by attractions include the ""Galloping Ghost"" arcade in Brookfield, the top-ranking Brookfield zoo, Freedom and Proksa parks in Berwyn. Tours through the Frank Lloyd Wright home and studio, as well as one of homes of writer Ernest Hemmingway are available in Oak Park.

Close proximity to lots of classic Chicago pizzerias like Lou Malgnati's makes getting a taste of Chicago's finest easy! Other good restaurant include Paisans for pizza/bar food and Lalo's for Mexican.

For those looking to drink, there is a bar down the street, but the best bars in town are ""Cigars and Stripes"", and ""James Joyce"", both on Ogden, and ""Fitzgerald's"" on Roosevelt if you're in the mood for music.

Located a little more than 2 miles away from the Stevenson expressway, travel downtown or to further-away suburbs is made easy!

Available on location is shared drive-way parking.

There's also a Metra BNSF station located only 1.0 mile north that can take you to Union Station, downtown. The pink line is 3.6 miles northeast and goes to the loop, downtown. The blue line is 4.3 miles north and goes through downtown before heading to O'Hare airport.

Parking of guest vehicles will usually be done in the driveway on the right side of the house. If there are multiples vehicles from multiple guests, an optimal parking situation will be determined by the host through communication with both parties.","Smoking allowed outside only.

*Do not leave hair in the shower.
*Do not use others' personal products/items without explicit permission.

Failure to abide by house rules may be grounds for a  no-refund cancellation of booking or additional fee.","The host resides on the first floor of the house, but physical availability will depend on the day. Socialization, questions, or concerns will be best through text messaging.","Berwyn is a quiet family suburb right outside of Chicago. The infamous historic route 66 that connects Chicago to California runs through (known as Ogden avenue). It's located between O'Hare and Midway international airport, making both relatively easy to access!

Common near-by attractions include the ""Galloping Ghost"" arcade in Brookfield, the top-ranking Brookfield zoo, Freedom and Proksa parks in Berwyn. Tours through the Frank Lloyd Wright home and studio, as well as one of homes of writer Ernest Hemmingway are available in Oak Park.

Close proximity to lots of classic Chicago pizzerias like Lou Malgnati's makes getting a taste of Chicago's finest easy! Other good restaurant include Paisans for pizza/bar food and Lalo's for Mexican.

For those looking to drink, there is a bar down the street, but the best bars in town are ""Cigars and Stripes"", and ""James Joyce"", both on Ogden, and ""Fitzgerald's"" on Roosevelt if you're in the mood for music.","Parking of guest vehicles will usually be done in the driveway on the right side of the house. If there are multiples vehicles from multiple guests, an optimal parking situation will be determined by the host through communication with both parties.","MUST BE DOG-FRIENDLY! The host and his canine companion reside on the first floor of the house.

The space available is on the second floor of the house. Included is access to a personal heater, air conditioner, and pedestal fan for keeping your space comfortable and climate controlled to your liking. The first floor has a common living room with couch and TV, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a private bedroom that the host uses. There are newly finished hardwood floors throughout all the rooms, with tile in the bathroom and kitchen. The basement has a clothing washer and dryer, but there is also a very nice laundromat across the street! Out in the backyard is a patio and grill.

A smaller second bedroom on the first floor of the house is also listed on AirBnB, therefore there may be another group of guests in the house at the same time.","MUST BE DOG-FRIENDLY! The host and his canine companion reside on the first floor of the house.

The room available is actually the entire second floor of a house, best for groups or those who require a large space for themselves! The first floor has a living room, kitchen, and bathroom. The basement has a clothing washer/dryer.

Located in a nice neighborhood not far from downtown Chicago and airports. This is NOT a hotel. The experience you will have here reflects my suburban Chicago home!","Located a little more than 2 miles away from the Stevenson expressway, travel downtown or to further-away suburbs is made easy!

Available on location is shared drive-way parking.

There's also a Metra BNSF station located only 1.0 mile north that can take you to Union Station, downtown. The pink line is 3.6 miles northeast and goes to the loop, downtown.

I love providing travel tips! I'll be coming and going to work M-F from about 8:45a to 6:30p and some evenings I have improv class. Saturday mornings I have comedy writing class, too. I'm happy to chat with you or leave you alone. My cat is also very friendly but can be shut out of your room.

Please reach out if you need anything :) Texting me directly will be the fastest way to reach me.

The neighborhood is super artsy and fun, great for foodies. Fantastic dive bar on corner with a Michelob Light sign hanging out front and partial walls- they have karaoke on the weekends. 

Delicious Kyrgyz restaurant called Jibek Jolu on Lincoln. Amazing food, BYOB. Pho’s Spicier Thai Cuisine is fantastic. 

Grind is a great coffee shop around the corner on Lincoln. 

Davis Theater (movies) around corner on Lincoln. 

A block south is Welles Park, which is beautiful grounds for hanging out, picnicking and bocce ball. Also a super cool restored wildflower prairie land corner. 

Check out the actual Lincoln Square, too- it has bookstores, restaurants, ice cream, a European grocery store, acupuncture, and festivals and farmers markets at different times.

Super easy to get around via public transportation! 3 min walk to Western Brown Line stop (30 min ride to downtown Chi)! Minutes to bus connections via 49, 78, and 50. Divvy/Lyft bikeshare stations also nearby. Street parking available.

Please read this before reserving our property:

Be very clear about your intentions when booking our home. There are to be absolutely no parties or outside guests other than those stated clearly in your reservation. Be very clear about the number of guests you are hosting in our property. If this rule is violated, we will have your entire reservation cancelled and your group removed from the property immediately without refund. Do not let this happen to you. We do not like surprises, and want to ensure all expectations are clear so everyone can enjoy their stay! By booking our property, you are agreeing to the contract below in its entirety:

Guest agrees to comply with all Terms and Conditions stated below, which are an essential part of this Agreement; Guest acknowledges he/she has read, understands, and is familiar with all Terms and Conditions.

Guest entering this Agreement represents himself/herself as agent for all parties occupying the Unit during the period of occupancy by Guest. Guest booking this unit must be at least 25 years of age and will be responsible for all other persons occupying the Unit and/or any other person(s) from time to time present in the Unit, for compliance with this Agreement, listed policies, ordinances, rules and regulations, and for any losses incurred by Owner and/or Manager or to the Unit due to the activities of any such persons, whether intentional, negligent, or otherwise.

ADDITIONAL OCCUPANTS: This unit can accommodate a maximum of the number of 6 guests; provided, however, that the overnight occupants of the Unit will be limited to those persons listed as occupants in the reservation. Guest acknowledges and agrees that in the event that more than the agreed number of occupants spend the night at the Unit, or more than the agreed number occupants are at any given time inside the Unit, this Agreement will be immediately terminated, the Unit must be vacated and the entire amount of the Rental Fees and Security Deposit provided by Guest will be forfeited, in addition to any costs associated with legal remedies that may be necessary.

PARTIES AND NOISE: Quite hours must be respected (10PM-8AM.) Parties and/or events of any kind are strictly prohibited at the Unit. For the purposes of this Agreement, Owner and/or Manager will consider that there is a party inside the Unit whenever the number of daytime occupants in the Unit exceeds the number of guests outlined in the reservation. Notwithstanding the former provision, even if the number of guests is not exceeded, all other common definitions of a party will be accepted, whenever the noise level inside the Unit is beyond what is reasonably accepted as normal. Any violation of this rule will result in an immediate termination of the reservations and this Agreement will be immediately terminated, the Unit must be vacated and the entire amount of the Fees and Security Deposit will be forfeited, in addition to any costs associated with legal remedies that may be necessary.

The living room is equipped with a couch that can sleep 1 and also a smart TV giving you access to Netflix, Hulu and more for all your streaming needs.

One of Chicago's creative epicenters lies just outside downtown Chicago in Wicker Park and Bucktown. These synonymous neighborhoods are famous for live music and nightlife, chef-driven restaurants and countless art galleries — many housed within the Flat Iron Arts Building. If you have an acute knowledge of craft cocktails or an affinity for coffee, plus want to sift through records or thrifted threads, there's no better area to sip and shop in the country.

The area has become a prevailing influence on Chicago's Michelin-rated, James Beard Award-winning dining scene, boasting some of the city's most sought after tables. Wicker Park and Bucktown are also known for their palate-pleasing nightcaps like renowned brewery Piece and mixology tour de force The Violet Hour.

Along North, Division, Milwaukee and Damen Avenues, you will find an unbelievable blend of vintage shops amid independently-owned boutiques touting fashions for both men and women, and luxury home goods and beauty products. On the same blocks are nationally-recognized names in fashion, and a mix of major retail chains that have also set up shop to satisfy the on-trend crowds.

The Western blue line train stop is about a 10-15 min walk and will give you easy access to the airport and downtown. If you have your own car,  highway 90/94 is 10 mins away. 

There are also plenty of Ubers/Lyfts around if needed!

There is free street parking alongside our street. Because this is a loft, the ceiling height is a little low upstairs where the bedroom is. If you are 6' and over, you will have to crouch upstairs. Sorry about this inconvenience, we hope you still find the place adequate!","PLEASE NOTE THAT WE CHARGE PER GUEST AFTER A SET NUMBER.

If you have an acute knowledge of craft cocktails or an affinity for coffee, plus want to sift through records or thrifted threads, there's no better area to sip and shop in the country.

The area has become a prevailing influence on Chicago's Michelin-rated, James Beard Award-winning dining scene, boasting some of the city's most sought after tables. Wicker Park and Bucktown are also known for their palate-pleasing nightcaps like renowned brewery Piece and mixology tour de force The Violet Hour.

Along North, Division, Milwaukee and Damen Avenues, you will find an unbelievable blend of vintage shops amid independently-owned boutiques touting fashions for both men and women, and luxury home goods and beauty products. On the same blocks are nationally-recognized names in fashion, and a mix of major retail chains that have also set up shop to satisfy the on-trend crowds.","There is free street parking alongside our street. Because this is a loft, the ceiling height is a little low upstairs where the bedroom is. If you are 6' and over, you will have to crouch upstairs. Sorry about this inconvenience, we hope you still find the place adequate!","Our space has all that's needed for your trip! As you walk-in to the unit, you'll notice the high ceilings and spacious atmosphere of the apartment. The living room is equipped with a couch that can sleep 1 and also a smart TV giving you access to Netflix, Hulu and more for all your streaming needs. We thoughtfully designed the space with pieces of decor to give an artsy vibe. 

To the left of the living room is our fully-stocked, simple kitchen for you to cook a meal if needed. Adjacent is a full bathroom for your use.

Your massive king sized bed is upstairs in the lofted part of the apartment. There is a desk as well in case you would like to get some work done!",Welcome to our artsy 1 BDR loft in Wicker Park! Enjoy a cozy room to yourself or with a small group on a quiet tree lined street as you explore Chicago or get some work done on a business trip! You are near the blue line train for easy access to O'Hare airport and downtown if needed.  A brand new walking trail is nearby if you're looking for a scenic walk in our beautiful city and you're near plenty of nightlife and restaurants!,"The Western blue line train stop is about a 10-15 min walk and will give you easy access to the airport and downtown. If you have your own car,  highway 90/94 is 10 mins away.

"Our goal is to make sure everyone is treated fairly and in consideration of others, so there are just a few things to be aware of so everyone has a great stay.

While you have a private bedroom, please keep in mind that others will want to use the common areas after you, so please don't leave them your mess. Also, if you happen to break something or something isn't working right, please let me know so I can fix it right away. Also, it's a shared kitchen, so please don't eat/drink food that isn't yours, if you need advice on where to buy food in the neighborhood, just ask.

Overall, the best way to think about how you should treat a home on airBNB is just like the camping rule: ""Leave no trace"".

Quiet times for the lower, 2nd/3rd floors is after 10pm on weeknights, midnight on weekends. It's a big space however (~7000 sq ft) and you are welcome to use the common areas late as needed as long as you are respectful of other guests. We simply ask that you to leave things how you found them.

Also, NO PARTIES, NO EVENTS, NO PHOTOSHOOTS. Do not book if you are planning on one. Both myself and staff live at the house full time, so please don't create a difficult situation for us. Having some drinks, playing pool, and casual gatherings for dinner, etc. is of course welcomed and encouraged (and in many cases others in the house may join you if welcomed!). But if you are inviting more then a friend or two that aren't staying with you at the house as part of your reservation, or create a disruption for other guests, your reservation will be cancelled without refund and you will be forced to vacate the premises immediately.

Please be sure to declare the correct number of guests for your stay. If you have anyone doing anything more then meeting you exclusively in the common areas, they need to be a registered guest. If you are found to have others with you that are not part of your guest count on airbnb, your reservation will be cancelled immediately, and without refund due to fee circumvention which is in direct violation of airBNB's terms of service.

For the safety of everyone, the home security system includes cameras that are installed in/around the home. This helps to protect your personal belongings while you are out, and increases your personal safety during your stay. They record everyone coming to/from the home, and monitor all of the common/public areas around the home. Please note that cameras are NOT installed in any private areas of the home, including bedrooms/bathrooms. The security setup is identical to those used at any boutique hotel or similar property where there are multiple guests occupying a single shared space.

Also, keep in mind that East Garfield Park is a neighborhood undergoing urban renewal. It's still a majority minority area with pockets of poverty which can be unsettling for some, but after living here for five years and hosting over 1000 guests on Airbnb, there have been no incidents of crime that have impacted me or any guests staying here. Many guests have actually commented on the fact that they were very glad for the opportunity to live in a real neighborhood of Chicago that was less then 20 minutes from downtown, giving them an opportunity away from the touristy areas when they wanted.

Like any area, with the exception of a few people everyone is generally friendly and helpful, please be respectful and treat everyone with respect, and they will gladly do so in return.",2.5 shared

This includes the kitchen, dining room, billiards room, parlor, laundry room, and of course common bathrooms.","This room is in the lower level of Fort Washington, a Richardsonian Romanesque mansion. Brick/Limestone walls create a cozy room a perfect retreat after a long day in Chicago. Sleeps up to 4 people on the king bed with sleeper sofa.

Easy unmetered street parking is readily available for those coming by car.

Full size kitchen, multiple living/outdoor areas, and laundry machines are available for use as well.

My other rooms are listed here: https://www.airbnb.com/users/22608682/listings

The space is in an old victorian era (c.1895) limestone/brick mansion located on Chicago's west side in the East Garfield Park neighborhood. It overlooks Washington Blvd. and is about a block from the Kedzie Green Line Train.

Please note if you book, this is an old house, with over 125 years of living. This means lumps, bumps, scratches, and things in general that are less then perfect. Most people enjoy this character of a house, and it's why they book.

I allow LUGGAGE DROP OFF! You can store your luggage in the closet before check-in and after check-out times, you can drop it off and pick it up as early and as late as you would like. Public transit options (train, bus, bike share) available about a block away.

The entire home except remaining private rooms are available. This includes the kitchen, dining room, billiards room, parlor, laundry room, and of course common bathrooms.

While I live at the house, there is a chance we may never cross paths during your stay due to the size of the home. 

I'm always available via messages/phone, so if anything comes up, let me know! I assume everything is going well unless it's brought to my attention.

I'm happy to provide advice on where to eat, how to get around, and where to shop, just ask!

The area itself is undergoing redevelopment. This doesn't mean boutique coffee instead of national chain coffee, it means Chicago and it’s outlying neighborhoods are mixed bags, on my block you’ll have $500,000 homes next to a boarded up one. 

If you are looking for a great place close to everything but with tons of room typically unknown for a city house, this is it. 

The house is very close to the Garfield Park Conservatory for reference.  You'll need to order delivery or take a train for restaurants, but it's all less then 20 minutes away.

The house is about 1 block from the Kedzie green line station. It’s 20 minutes from downtown and about 45 from either airport. There is ample street parking in front of the home for those arriving by car.

I mention this in the neighborhood section of my listing as well, but it's worth repeating here. 

Please do your research and know where you are booking. I've lived here for over 7 years and never had a concern for my own safety or that of the thousands of my guests.

Also, please note that I don't have keyed locks on interior doors of the home. If this is a problem for you, please don't book. I trust you, the guest, with my single most valuable asset and all of my personal belongings. I have never been given a reason to doubt that trust in this community, but if you plan on breaking that trust, please don't book.","Our goal is to make sure everyone is treated fairly and in consideration of others, so there are just a few things to be aware of so everyone has a great stay.

Also, if you happen to break something or something isn't working right, please let me know so I can fix it right away. Also, it's a shared kitchen, so please don't eat/drink food that isn't yours, if you need advice on where to buy food in the neighborhood, just ask.

Overall, the best way to think about how you should treat a home on airBNB is just like the camping rule: ""Leave no trace"".

Quiet times for the lower, 2nd/3rd floors is after 10pm on weeknights, midnight on weekends. It's a big space however (~7000 sq ft) and you are welcome to use the common areas late as needed as long as you are respectful of other guests. We simply ask that you to leave things how you found them.

Also, NO PARTIES, NO EVENTS, NO PHOTOSHOOTS. Do not book if you are planning on one. Both myself and staff live at the house full time, so please don't create a difficult situation for us. Having some drinks, playing pool, and casual gatherings for dinner, etc. is of course welcomed and encouraged (and in many cases others in the house may join you if welcomed!). But if you are inviting more then a friend or two that aren't staying with you at the house as part of your reservation, or create a disruption for other guests, your reservation will be cancelled without refund and you will be forced to vacate the premises immediately.

Please be sure to declare the correct number of guests for your stay. If you have anyone doing anything more then meeting you exclusively in the common areas, they need to be a registered guest. If you are found to have others with you that are not part of your guest count on airbnb, your reservation will be cancelled immediately, and without refund due to fee circumvention which is in direct violation of airBNB's terms of service.

For the safety of everyone, the home security system includes cameras that are installed in/around the home. This helps to protect your personal belongings while you are out, and increases your personal safety during your stay. They record everyone coming to/from the home, and monitor all of the common/public areas around the home. Please note that cameras are NOT installed in any private areas of the home, including bedrooms/bathrooms. The security setup is identical to those used at any boutique hotel or similar property where there are multiple guests occupying a single shared space.

Also, keep in mind that East Garfield Park is a neighborhood undergoing urban renewal. It's still a majority minority area with pockets of poverty which can be unsettling for some, but after living here for five years and hosting over 1000 guests on Airbnb, there have been no incidents of crime that have impacted me or any guests staying here. Many guests have actually commented on the fact that they were very glad for the opportunity to live in a real neighborhood of Chicago that was less then 20 minutes from downtown, giving them an opportunity away from the touristy areas when they wanted.

Like any area, with the exception of a few people everyone is generally friendly and helpful, please be respectful and treat everyone with respect, and they will gladly do so in return.","While I live at the house, there is a chance we may never cross paths during your stay due to the size of the home. 

I'm always available via messages/phone, so if anything comes up, let me know! I assume everything is going well unless it's brought to my attention.

I'm happy to provide advice on where to eat, how to get around, and where to shop, just ask!","The area itself is undergoing redevelopment. This doesn't mean boutique coffee instead of national chain coffee, it means Chicago and it’s outlying neighborhoods are mixed bags, on my block you’ll have $500,000 homes next to a boarded up one. 

If you are looking for a great place close to everything but with tons of room typically unknown for a city house, this is it. 

The house is very close to the Garfield Park Conservatory for reference.  You'll need to order delivery or take a train for restaurants, but it's all less then 20 minutes away.","I mention this in the neighborhood section of my listing as well, but it's worth repeating here. 

Please do your research and know where you are booking. I've lived here for over 7 years and never had a concern for my own safety or that of the thousands of my guests.

Also, please note that I don't have keyed locks on interior doors of the home. If this is a problem for you, please don't book. I trust you, the guest, with my single most valuable asset and all of my personal belongings. I have never been given a reason to doubt that trust in this community, but if you plan on breaking that trust, please don't book.","The space is in an old victorian era (c.1895) limestone/brick mansion located on Chicago's west side in the East Garfield Park neighborhood. It overlooks Washington Blvd. and is about a block from the Kedzie Green Line Train.

Please note if you book, this is an old house, with over 125 years of living. This means lumps, bumps, scratches, and things in general that are less then perfect. Most people enjoy this character of a house, and it's why they book.

I allow LUGGAGE DROP OFF! You can store your luggage in the closet before check-in and after check-out times, you can drop it off and pick it up as early and as late as you would like. Public transit options (train, bus, bike share) available about a block away.","This room is in the lower level of Fort Washington, a Richardsonian Romanesque mansion. Brick/Limestone walls create a cozy room a perfect retreat after a long day in Chicago. Sleeps up to 4 people on the king bed with sleeper sofa.

This place is very close to Downtown Chicago, and west loop where you can find  amazing restaurants and good bars, public transportation (buses ) are pretty close too!

The style of everything inside the house is modern, cozy and minimalist! It’s a great place if you wan to be close of the Chicago’s most common attractions but our rooms are small and also common areas.. We selected a kind of frame where you can put your luggage under it if you want to have more space . Also our rooms has a small portable organizer or a closet, a tiny table and stool and a table lamp.

Parking is such a tough situation in Chicago. In this spot you will need either to rent our private spot or to have the stickers for parking on the street ! Just make sure 1) you read all signs posted in the street/ trees or fences that says information about street cleaning , reparation, disabilities parking, school days, permit parking, etc 2) you are not over the crosswalk, near a hydrant, or wrong way.

If you want save some money and being right in front United Center and close to downtown, surrounding great public transportation this could be a great option for you!

I work at home in the unit above and am available if problems arise either with the facility or for general information about surrounding facilities for example (Loyola, Mac Neal and Oak Park hospitals within in mile of the property; CTA rapid transit with UIC and O'Hare connections only a 10 to 15 minute walk).

Forest Park is a quiet community with a diverse population. In fourteen years here, I have not experienced any security problems. People around me are friendly.

Access to public transportation is easy and dependable. The CTA's Blue Line connects directly to O'hare from Forest Park.  However, it first makes a loop through Chicago's primary commercial center (9 miles due East) and it is thus convenient to State Street and N. Michigan Ave. Shopping as well as a number of Museums, Grant Park activities. and River tourist attractions.  By car, you have quick access to the the 290 expressway (Chicgo's belt line) and within a fifteen mile radius you can travel to Oak Brook in the west, O'Hare (NW), with other good roads to MidWay (SE), Skokie to the North of Chicago and Oak Lawn to the South.  Locally their is one grocery store less than half a block south and and another two blocks north.  The shopping center to the south also includes   a WalMart , a fitness center and numerous fast food restaurants along Roosevelt Rd.. In the Summer, the Forest Park Swimming Pool, water park and Tennis courts are five blocks due north. The Forest Park Library is also close by-just north of the expressway and the Forest Park CTA station.

Anchored by a beautiful stretch of shoreline to the east and dotted with train stops from two ‘L' lines, Lakeview is one of Chicago's liveliest and most accessible neighborhoods. Several distinct areas — East Lakeview, Central Lakeview, Boystown and Wrigleyville — meld together to form a lakefront community that celebrates diversity and boasts something for every type of visitor.

Hit the bustling commercial districts along Belmont Avenue, Lincoln Avenue, Southport Avenue, Clark Street, Halsted Street and Broadway Street to shop — be it for vintage frocks, designer jeans or leather biker gear — or live it up with the locals at the seemingly endless options for bars and pubs, and the dozens of celebrated restaurants in between.

Arts and culture come in the form of live music venues, several summer street festivals and a thriving scene for theater, dance and comedy (Belmont Theater District is a stellar collection of nearly 20 independent companies).

Not to be outdone by its extraordinary entertainment landscape, Lakeview makes full use of its slice of Lincoln Park, a 1,200-acre oasis dedicated to the outdoors. Here you will find the scenic Lakefront Trail, a golf course and driving range, a boat harbor, a bird sanctuary, tennis courts and grassy playing fields that are also perfect for picnics or just soaking in the views.

Easy access (7 minute walk!) to the Red/Brown/Purple line trains with transit all over the city, as well as many bus lines.

The best point about this place is how close It’s to Downtown (15 min-public transportation, 10 min-car) If you going to a Event at United Center it’s so close as well( 10 min walking).

The room is private but you will share common areas (pool table, kitchen , living room, and the 3 bathrooms ) with other Airbnb guests. Usually none of this get crowd becase most of Airbnb people are most of the time outside the house knowing the city, in concerts, interviews, etc, and they don’t spend much time in the house. A private apartment in the area usually cost over 120$ p/night plus taxes and fees which is in total almost 200$ p/night ! If you want save some money and being close to downtown, surrounding great public transportation and with free street parking this could be a great option for you! 

The room has a good size for the Queen size bed it has. If you want to add 3 or 4 people in the reservation I could add and extra air mattress for you with no extra charge, but then the room will become smaller for luggage becase you will have two beds on it. This is a good option if you want to save even more money otherwise you can book two rooms! 

As most of United States Houses this is not made with concrete so you will hear people walking. It doesn’t bother most of the people but if you are a very light sleeper you should choose a modern apartment (three floor apartments or traditional houses all has the same problem) or have an earphone or something for block the sound.","1.

This place is very close to Downtown Chicago, and it’s a great picturesque neighborhood with a lot of murals (for what is known), great restaurants, good night life. We have one block away my favorite Margarita’s place in Chicago! 

There are few free street parking around the neighborhood. 18 bus is just 1/2 block away. 18th Pink line is 15min walk. 60 bus is 8min walk. McCormick Place is 9min far by car/25min by public transportation. United Center is 10min far by car/30min by public transportation. Rush is 9min by car/21min by public transportation. Grant Park is 9min by car/28min by public transportation. The Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium and the Planetarium is 11 min far by car/27 min by public transportation. Uber are very cheap 5-10$ to those places specially if you choose the pool option!

This is a safe and night life neighborhood so you can walk around it but without forget it that you are in Chicago so don’t leave belongings at sight in your car. Parking is such a tough situation in Chicago although there are few streets where you can Free park around the house (Racine street, May street  but one street behind the airbnb building not in front of airbnb building, Cullerton street, 19th street, Carpenter Street, 18th south side ). Parking is usually easy before 5pm, after 5pm is hard to find a free spot but not imposible. Just make sure 1) you read all signs posted in the street/ trees or fences that says information about street cleaning , reparation, disabilities parking, permit parking, school days, etc 2) you are not over the crosswalk, near a hydrant, or wrong way.

The room is private but you will share common areas ( kitchen , living room, and the bathroom/s) with other Airbnb guests. Usually none of this get crowd because most of Airbnb guests are most of the time outside the house knowing the city, in concerts, interviews, etc, and they don’t spend much time in the house. A private apartment in the area usually cost over 120$ p/night plus taxes and fees which is in total almost 200$ p/night ! If you want save some money and being close to downtown, surrounding great public transportation and with free street parking this could be a great option for you! 

The room has one full size bed. If you want to add 3rd or 4th guest in the reservation I could add 1 extra air mattress with no extra fee if the reservation is set for 3 or 4. If the reservation is for 2 and you’d like to have an extra air mattress we charge $15p/night and we provide air mattress and linens for it. the room will become smaller for luggage becase you will have two beds on it. This is a good option if you want to save even more money otherwise you can book two rooms! 
As most houses in United States this is not made with concrete so you will hear people walking or outside sounds. It doesn’t bother most of the guest but if you are a very light sleeper maybe you should choose an entire place. or have an earphone or something to block the sound.

We have cameras ON in common areas, one is located outside the apartment in the entrance the other one is in the living room.

With 2 full bathrooms, it's ideal for groups traveling together, & since we recently rehabbed the building, it's practically brand new! We're just a half-mile west of the West Loop, too, so it's an easy walk to some of the city's best restaurants, bars, & shops!

This a spacious unit that has been completely remodeled. It has 3 beds and 2 bathrooms, updated kitchen, free street parking, and access to a common laundry room. Extremely close to the United Center and a Blue Line stop. Be downtown in less than 10 min.

You'll have full access to my 3BR/2BA apartment, and shared access to the basement laundry room.

I am always available for any questions or issues that arise.

The condo is located in the Near West Side, steps away from the United Center and just minutes from Chicago’s hottest neighborhood - the West Loop. Other West Side neighborhoods, such as Wicker Park, Logan Square, Ukrainian Village and West Town are also just minutes away and well worth a visit during your visit in Chicago!

Approximately 5 min walk to the Illinois Medical District Blue Line station which goes straight to downtown and O'Hare Airport. Also located next to the 126/Jackson bus route which takes you right to Michigan Ave., and the 50/Damen bus, which takes you right into Wicker Park. It's easy to get around town without a car from here!

In addition to our proximity to the United Center, we also enjoy easy access to and from O'Hare Airport, and conveniently located near Malcolm X Community College, Rush, and UIC. It's a 15 minute walk to Union Park and Randolph Street Market, and a 10 minute drive to Google's Chicago Office, as well as McDonald's HQ. And, since we're so close to downtown, all of Chicago's sights - the Art Institute, the Bean, Maggie Daley Park - are just a quick bus ride away!","House Rules:

3+ hours subject to a half day rate or standard $125
 
CHECK-OUT TIME
Check-out time is prompt at 11 AM.  We would love to let you stay forever, but the issue is we have someone checking in right after you.  If you have not been approved for a late check-out, you will be subject to a $50 fine each 15 minute interval that you delay the Cleaning Team.  We value our Cleaner's Team time and work and hope you do as well.  A delayed checkout only causes stress and extra work for them.   We hope you understand, so please make sure to check out on time in order to avoid any fine.  If a late checkout time is mandatory, please make sure to make arrangements upon booking.  We will do our best to accommodate your request pending availability.  

SECURITY 
Must provide copy of photo ID upon booking via the message center or via email to stay@bangtel.com

PARTIES / EVENTS
Additional refundable security deposit will be taken for parties and events.  

Additional fees apply for any guests over the maximum allowed number of guests on the listing.  Parties and event fees are based on a case by case basis, number of guests, and duration of the event. 

NOISE
Please respect your neighbors with late night noise after 10 PM.  
The building is a shared apartment building.  Therefore, please be respectful with noise in the hallways and closing doors quietly.
 
PARTY GLITTER & CONFETTI FEE
Those small little shiny fun circles are not fun at all for our cleaning team to pick up.  They are actually a nightmare for the clean-up team and we politely warn you that there will be an additional fee for sprinkling glitter or confetti.  Please note, you are more than welcome to wear that lovely sequined jumpsuit, by all means bring it to the party. ;-)
 
SHOES
No matter how fabulous your shoes are we do ask that you PLEASE remove them when in the house.
 
NO SMOKING PLEASE
There is absolutely no smoking allowed in the unit.  You are welcome to smoke outside, but please dispose in the provided ashtrays. There is a $500 fine for smoking in the unit.

Please also shut and lock all doors and windows.

If someone from your group leaves with the key fob(s) upon checkout, we need to receive the key back within one week of checkout or you will be charged.  Please provide a tracking # if shipped.

No pets allowed. If there is pet hair to be cleaned, there will be a $20/fee.

Only outside the house. If there is evidence of indoor smoking, there will be a $20/fee.

BEDROOM USE
We offer the lowest cleaning fee in the city at only $40. Most places charge up to $120. To keep our low rates we ask the following:

Single guests and couples can only use 1 bedroom, otherwise there will be a fee of $10/night when the second bedroom is used due to additional cleaning time and laundry. 

This is also why there is an additional charge of $10/night/guest when more than 2 guests book. Again it helps cover the additional cleaning cost for the second bedroom.

Bohemian attic with 2 beds 1 bath in a classic Chicago home that is located on a quiet tree-lined street, near many food spots. 

Comfy beds, Roku Smart TV, 60 mbps internet, free beverages & snacks. 

Ideal location between 2 train lines that take you to all must-see neighborhoods:
• Brown line: Lincoln Park, Old Town. 
• Blue line: Logan Square, Bucktown.

The attic is a completely separate unit with private back entrance, self check-in, and free street parking. You do not share the living space with others. 

HOME —This is a classic Chicago home built over 100 years ago that features wooden floors, a claw foot bathtub, and separate kitchen and living areas. 

KITCHEN —The kitchen is fully equipped for cooking and a high-grade filtered water tank. All of our guests get free beverages and snacks. Small dining table fits 2 people. 

BEDROOMS—The bedrooms have queen size beds and dressers. There is a portable heater unit in each room. We store extra linens, towels, and blankets to make sure you are comfortable. 

BATHROOM—The bathroom is a traditional claw foot bath that is raised higher than a regular bathtub and you have to take a bigger step to get in. There is a shampoo and shower gel dispenser attached to the wall in front of the shower head, and we have extra shower items behind the sink mirror. 

FURNITURE—The furniture is curated from around the world featuring pieces from South and Central America, Europe, South Korea, Thailand, Egypt, Turkey, and Israel. 

DISCLAIMER: some of our guests have reported seeing bugs in the apartment likely due to being an attic unit and a 100+ year old home. We have taken several measures to minimize the number of bugs including hiring an exterminator, scheduling bug maintenance cleans, placing insect traps, and ultrasound devices that are safe for humans and pets. We also provide insect sprays in the common spaces and the rooms in case you want to use one. In spite of this, we cannot promise we can get rid of all the insects but we will continue to do our best to keep the premises as insect free as possible.

The entire unit is for guests only.

Chicago Public Transit (CTA) takes you to must-see neighborhoods in Chicago like Logan Square, Wrigleville, Boystown, Lincoln Park, and many more. Our guidebook tells you all the stops and what neighborhoods and spots you can check out as if you were a local  :)

Trains
∞ Brown Line (15 min walking, 5 min bus ride) 
∞ Blue Line (5 min bus ride) 

Bus 
∞ Irving Park #80
∞ Kimball #82

A CTA ride includes 2 transfers within 2 hours, so you can take the bus by our home and then transfer to the train—and viceversa—to get everywhere. Alternatively you can buy a 1, 3, 7 day CTA pass for unlimited rides including the airport.",True,True,False,False,,True,False,50.0,"[{'milestones': {'titles': ['<b>Jan 11, 3:00PM</b>', 'Check-in'], 'subtitles': [], 'type': 'check_in'}, 'localized_cancellation_policy_name': 'Moderate', 'cancellation_policy_label': 'moderate', 'cancellation_policy_price_type': None, 'cancellation_policy_price_factor': 0.0, 'cancellation_policy_id': 4, 'book_it_module_tooltip': 'Free cancellation for 48 hours', 'subtitle': 'After that, cancel before 3:00PM on Jan 6 and get a full refund, minus the service fee.'}]",0.0,10.0,2,2020-01-11,2020-01-13,2019-12-28,2019-12-13 21:28:37+00:00,2019-10-12 21:46:54+00:00

Norwood Park is one of the safest neighborhoods in Chicago and is very family oriented with many police and firefighters living here. There is an up and coming “downtown” area featuring excellent restaurants such as Mo Daley’s Pub & Grille, Bangkok Belly, Iron Horse Ale House, Nonna Silvia’s, and Lucky Grill. For grocery, there's Whole Foods, Costco, Target, and Mariano's all 2 miles away. We recently got our first high end liquor store at Norwood Wine & Spirits. Nearby, the adjacent neighborhoods of Edison Park and Park Ridge have loads of excellent restaurants and night life. Rosemont Entertainment District is a short ride toward O’Hare on the CTA Blue Line train and features a sort of Disney-like fake city with an Irish/DJ club (Five Roses), a billiards-gaming-bowling alley (Kings), Brazilian Steak House (Fogo De Chao), premium movie theater (AMC Muvico), comedy club (Zanies), indoor skydiving (iFly), and of course the Donald E. Stephens Convention Center.

The nearby CTA Blue Line train is a super convenient and cheap ($2.25) way to get around Chicago and inter-connects with other CTA train lines including the Red, Brown, Green, Orange, Yellow, Pink, and Purple lines. In addition, many CTA bus lines connect with the trains…You won’t need a car at Bob’s House to get anywhere you want to go in Chicago, but of course Uber and Lyft are also excellent and inexpensive ways to get around. You can get an Uber or Lyft driver to pick you up here within 5 minutes of ordering.

Who’s Bob, anyway ?
Bob grew up in this very house when it was brand new in 1922 at the start of the roaring 20’s. I made friends with Bob and he was an endless wealth of knowledge and entertainment about the people who had lived on the block over the decades. He knew a lot about Chicago as well, being a retired professional cab driver. He was a spry 86 years old, still mowing the grass on this enormous property when he decided to downsize and move to a retirement village down the street. I bought the house from him and decided to re-envision it into a vacation rental, adding all the modern appointments while maintaining that Chicago class and charm that was built into the original design. Bob can still be spotted around the neighborhood cruising in his huge Buick LeSabre old man car.

Update Feb 2018: Bob sold his LeSabre and has been spotted driving a white Chevy Malibu around the neighborhood.","We get many inquiries about the ""No Parties and Events Allowed"" rule which is intended to apply to the typical loud, alcohol-fueled type of blow out party where several dozen people show up and annoy the neighbors and invite the cops to pay you a visit.

"1) The entire property is smoke and vapor free. We have marijuana and tobacco chemical sensors on the property. They know it's not cooking smoke, and they react to airborne particulate, not the smell on your clothes. The PolySens® technology works, so exit the building if you want to smoke/vape or you'll be fined $500 and asked to leave.

2) Your reservation has paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number, whether visiting or sleeping, you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first.

3) Quiet hours are 10PM-8AM. Noise should not be heard coming from your apartment. This is a quiet residential building. 95% of our guests have no issues, and never hear from us. We will be sure to send you at least 2 warnings prior to asking anyone to leave, but one way or another, the apartment must be quiet.

4) Parties, events, and commercial activity are not allowed. 

5) All gathering spaces except the lobby are strictly reserved for residents only.

6) Shoes and shirt or other upper body clothing must be worn in the lobby, hallways, and elevator. Undergarments should not be visible.

7) We reserve the right to ask you to leave without a refund if any of the above rules are broken.

And with so many bars, restaurants, and shops, you'll have no idea where to start - until you check out our curated guidebook! 

We’ve got tips about the best bars, coffee shops and grab-and-go breakfast, high-end can't miss dinners, quick meals, late nights and boozy brunch, plus extensive day trips all throughout the city - plus what we consider the best Cubs game day experience.

OVERRATED TOURIST TRAP
- Navy Pier: 16 min
The Children's Museum, Shakespeare Theater, or Imax theater are all great. Unless you have plans for those - seriously, skip Navy Pier. We know plenty of better food, better views, and better things to do. Ask us for alternatives!

The building amenities are reserved for residents only. Airbnb guests have booked an apartment only.

Parking is not included for vehicles larger than mid-size, such as full-size SUVs and trucks, minivans, vans, RVs and trailers. 

We do not accept instant bookings from residents of the Chicago metropolitan area as identified by profile city or phone number area code. If you live near Chicago and would like to book a stay, please send us a message with a little more information about your plans

Immediately after booking, we will send you a few questions about your arrival time, contact info, number of guests/visitors, and to name our favorite restaurant, which is listed at the bottom of the house rules. Guests will not be allowed to check in without providing complete answers.","1) The entire property is smoke and vapor free. We have marijuana and tobacco chemical sensors on the property. They know it's not cooking smoke, and they react to airborne particulate, not the smell on your clothes. The PolySens® technology works, so exit the building if you want to smoke/vape or you'll be fined $500 and asked to leave.

2) Your reservation has paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number, whether visiting or sleeping, you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first.

3) Quiet hours are 10PM-8AM. Noise should not be heard coming from your apartment. This is a quiet residential building. 95% of our guests have no issues, and never hear from us. We will be sure to send you at least 2 warnings prior to asking anyone to leave, but one way or another, the apartment must be quiet.

4) Parties, events, and commercial activity are not allowed. 

5) All gathering spaces except the lobby are strictly reserved for residents only.

6) Shoes and shirt or other upper body clothing must be worn in the lobby, hallways, and elevator. Undergarments should not be visible.

7) We reserve the right to ask you to leave without a refund if any of the above rules are broken.

8) We do not accept instant bookings from residents of the Chicago metropolitan area as identified by profile city or phone number area code. If you live near Chicago and would like to book a stay, please send us a message with a little more information about your plans

8) Our favorite restaurant in Chicago is La Scarola.","Immediately after booking, we will send you a few questions about your arrival time, contact info, number of guests/visitors, and to name our favorite restaurant, which is listed at the bottom of the house rules.

Wrigleyville:  the Chicago Cubs play in the heart of this residential neighborhood. The building is just 3 blocks from Wrigley FIeld and the Chicago Cubs - so avoid game-day traffic and walk it! With sports bars and casual eateries galore, there's always something happening. 

Boystown: the Midwest's largest LGBTQ+ neighborhood! You'll stay at the top of the main drag, right on the Pride Parade route! You're moments from dance clubs and dive bars, local restaurants and quirky meals, and the most welcoming vibe anywhere in the city. Ask us for suggestions, don't be shy!

And while the combined neighborhood has it's share of excitement, ultimately, you'll enjoy an upscale, convenient, and relaxed residential setting. Easy grocery runs - less than one block from Whole Foods, and a 2-minute Uber from Jewel Osco, one of Chicago's large grocery chains. Just 4 blocks from the Addison Red Line L train station, downtown in 20 minutes!

Chicago’s North Side is the most prosperous with the most things to do, bringing a vibrancy far beyond the tourist/business district downtown. Wrigleyville and Boystown, both part of the Lakeview community, make up it's beating heart. The area might look like it’s off center from downtown, but it’s really in the middle of everything. 


And with so many bars, restaurants, and shops, you'll have no idea where to start - until you check out our curated guidebook! 

We’ve got tips about the best bars, coffee shops and grab-and-go breakfast, high-end can't miss dinners, quick meals, late nights and boozy brunch, plus extensive day trips all throughout the city - plus what we consider the best Cubs game day experience. One word: bleachers - and you can see them from your windows! We put our heart into the guidebook, and you’ll find advice on other can’t-miss places worth a train or Uber ride, including FIVE distinct nightlife districts throughout the city! 

We've heard from guest after guest that they loved the guidebook, so please, take a look during your stay!","The building amenities are reserved for residents only. Airbnb guests have booked an apartment only.

"Before you book, please be aware of the following:

We strive to maintain the absolute highest standard of service on Airbnb. However, we are not a 5-star hotel and are therefore unable to provide everything that you would expect from a hotel. If you have specific things that you are very picky about, please discuss with us before booking.

Due to changing regulations on Airbnb in Chicago, we must ask that you maintain discretion with building staff. Please do not approach them with any requests. Definitely do not approach them to collect keys or to “check-in.”

Once you arrive, we will ask you to follow our house rules. Please read these rules carefully and take them seriously. Failure to comply can result in forfeiture of your deposit and termination of your reservation without a refund.

- This building is 100% non-smoking. No smoking or vaping of anything inside the unit or on building premises. Chicago law prohibits smoking within 15 feet of any building entrance.
- This a quiet and upscale residential building. Please observe quiet hours from 10:00 PM - 8:00 AM daily. Our neighbors are very sensitive and they will report loud noise. Any noise disturbances reported by neighbors or police will result in forfeiture of partial or full deposit.
- Absolutely no guests not in the reservation are allowed in the apartment or the building common areas.
- No pets allowed unless approved. Bringing in a pet without notice or approval will result in a forfeiture of partial or full deposit.
- Please ensure you have left the premises and returned any keys issued to you by the agreed-upon check out time. Failure to do so will result in a $250 late check out fee.
- Lockouts will result in a $150 fee per occurrence. Additionally, lost keys will incur a $250 per key fee.

Please note: there is a glitch in the map settings, and the actual location is 250 feet to the North.

You will be greeted by a personal Guest Relations Manager upon arrival, who will also take care of you during your stay. As an ENVITAE guest, you will also have access to round the clock concierge services.

Everything you need is right outside your doorstep! Downtown Chicago is a city with an appetite—for food, of course, but also for design, history, and culture. Come here to marvel at the cutting-edge architecture or take in the gorgeous views of Lake Michigan; to spend a day cheering with baseball fans and a night laughing at a comedy show; to shop, to visit renowned institutions like the Field Museum, The Art Institute and the Adler Planetarium, and to experience the legendary blues scene. To do all this, you'll need nourishment: taste deep-dish pizza, piled-high hot dogs, Italian beef sandwiches, and more.

You are minutes away from bus and train stops.  

We find our guests prefer to use Uber, which is a very convenient and cheap way to get around the city.

There is no parking available in the building, however there are several garages and lots within a block of the building.  We recommend the apps SpotHero or ParkWhiz to find and book parking.

We are able to provide no more than 2 key/fobs for access to the building and apartment.

Please be advised that all guests will be asked to sign a rental usage agreement that governs the terms of your stay.  For the protection of all parties, the booking party will also be required to provide a copy of a valid government issued ID and matching credit card prior to check in. This information is collected for verification purposes only and is not stored or otherwise used for any other purpose
By completing the reservation you agree to the following:
    - I agree to be bound by our rental terms and conditions.
    - I acknowledge that I will be required to provide a copy of a valid government issued ID and matching credit card prior to check in.
    - I acknowledge that I may be required to undergo a background check if mandated by the property management company or the building, as stated in accordance by my rental agreement and condition of the booking.","Before you book, please be aware of the following:

We strive to maintain the absolute highest standard of service on Airbnb. However, we are not a 5-star hotel and are therefore unable to provide everything that you would expect from a hotel. If you have specific things that you are very picky about, please discuss with us before booking.

Due to changing regulations on Airbnb in Chicago, we must ask that you maintain discretion with building staff. Please do not approach them with any requests. Definitely do not approach them to collect keys or to “check-in.”

Once you arrive, we will ask you to follow our house rules. Please read these rules carefully and take them seriously. Failure to comply can result in forfeiture of your deposit and termination of your reservation without a refund.

- This building is 100% non-smoking. No smoking or vaping of anything inside the unit or on building premises. Chicago law prohibits smoking within 15 feet of any building entrance.
- This a quiet and upscale residential building. Please observe quiet hours from 10:00 PM - 8:00 AM daily. Our neighbors are very sensitive and they will report loud noise. Any noise disturbances reported by neighbors or police will result in forfeiture of partial or full deposit.
- Absolutely no guests not in the reservation are allowed in the apartment or the building common areas.
- No pets allowed unless approved. Bringing in a pet without notice or approval will result in a forfeiture of partial or full deposit.
- Please ensure you have left the premises and returned any keys issued to you by the agreed-upon check out time. Failure to do so will result in a $250 late check out fee.
- Lockouts will result in a $150 fee per occurrence. Additionally, lost keys will incur a $250 per key fee.

Please note: there is a glitch in the map settings, and the actual location is 250 feet to the North. Please contact us before making the booking to discuss if you are targeting a very specific location.","You will be greeted by a personal Guest Relations Manager upon arrival, who will also take care of you during your stay.

The closet in the main guest room is quite large, so we ask that guest's coats be kept upstairs as our coat closet is already too full. 
     Our house is not child-proofed, so we expect parents to monitor their children at all times while here. 
     We provide basic breakfast foods - muffins, butter, juice, coffee, tea, cereal, milk. If you want additional food or have dietary restrictions, there is a shelf in the fridge where you can keep it. We have many grocery stores nearby, and will happily direct you. 
     Please, absolutely no food in the bedrooms, things get spilled, it attracts ants and the dogs, which in one case resulted in a trip to the emergency vet.  No glass glasses in the bathroom - we provide unbreakable ones for you to use. And please hang towels on hooks, not over the curtain shower rail, and don't use our towels to remove makeup. It doesn't come out. (Also, please remove makeup before lying on the bed linens - we have had several pillow cases ruined.) 
     We do not allow smoking either inside the house or on the deck. Thank you for remembering this is our home and not a hotel. 
     Our cleaning lady comes every other Tuesday - if you are here when she comes, she will clean the bathroom but will not go in the guest bedrooms unless you request it.
     Please ask us if there is anything you need help with - we want you to have a safe and comfortable stay.","Happy to help with directions, willing to share coffee or tea and hear about your day!  Will help with restaurant recommendations and reservations. We will help with public transport schedules and information.
We are bird watchers, and can recommend good local birding spots, and when time allows, will take guests birding.  Husband retired, wife works from home office.","Evanston is a great community, with wonderful restaurants, a vibrant downtown and lake front, plus the amenities of Northwestern University.  Our home is on a tree-lined street near multiple parks, with jogging paths, free tennis courts and a fishing/duck pond. We are also very close to Old Orchard Shopping Mall, with many major and specialty retailers and a large cinema. The Chicago Botanic Garden is about a 15 minute drive away, Evanston Hospital and Light House Beach are a 15 minute bus ride down Central St. 
     Ryan Field (Dyche Stadium) is straight down Central St., where NU plays football, and also where the NU Welsh-Ryan basketball arena is located. 
     We are also very close to the Presbyterian Homes (2 blocks) and 3 Crowns Park (6 blocks) retirement communities.
     Every Saturday during the summer and fall, there's a wonderful farmer's market in downtown Evanston, with over 50 vendors and free parking. In the winter, a smaller market opens in the Ecology Center and at a local church.","There is alternate side of the street parking on street cleaning days - please read the posted sign or ask us which side of the street to park on to avoid getting a ticket. Street cleaning is on Thursdays and Fridays the first week of the month, April - Sept.","Beautiful, comfortable, art-filled home. Owners are international travelers who have stayed in B&B accommodations around the world.

If you only need one room, we will not rent the second bedroom to anyone else. 
     Convenient to NU, public transport, Evanston parks and beaches, very close to Old Orchard Mall, Presbyterian Homes, 3 Crowns Park, Evanston Hospital, plus Baha'i Temple, Centennial Park in Wilmette. 15 minute drive to Chicago Botanic Gardens, easy access to trains into Chicago. 
    The larger room is spacious and contains an extra very comfortable IKEA chair/bed that is suitable for an extra adult who is not over 6' tall or a child over 2 years. Our house is not toddler proofed.
    We provide a front door key for guests that is kept by the door - we ask that guests take a key with them when they go out and put it back when they come in. A lost key will cost you $35 for us to get the lock re-keyed, so please be careful with your key.","Lovely Tudor art-filled home near Old Orchard, NU, Evanston Hosp., public trans., Pres.

During the day, the neighborhood’s sprawling namesake park—with its gardens, paths, museums, and beaches—provides a welcome respite from the hustle-bustle of the big city.

NOTES: 
(1) REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY (see below)
(2) The host typically would like to greet the guests in person, occasionally this may not be possible.  In the latter case, please contact the host for the procedure of ""Self Check-in"". 
(3) Let the host know if you plan to drive so the parking matter can be addressed if needed.

REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY
Guests choose a place to stay based what it serves them the best.  We would like to highlight a few items worth considering and invite you to book this place.
(a) We run a very efficient operation and have a very competitive room rate with high quality rooms and services;
(b) This house has an exceptional great location.  It is about 10 minutes to a Green Line Station by walking (hence very close to downtown Chicago) and has convenient access to west, north west, and south west of greater Chicagoland by car.
(c) Free parking is provided.  Parking can be very very expensive in any larger metropolitan, including downtown Chicago.  Therefore it is much more economical to park here and take the train to downtown Chicago. If you rent a room in or near downtown Chicago, you implicitly or explicitly spend a lot of money just on parking.
(d) The ""Occupancy Tax"" is about 11% here which is much less than 23% or higher (doubled) in Chicago. The occupancy tax is paid by the guests based on the sum of room rate and cleaning fee.  With this tax and parking cost in mind, it is much more economical (and without losing convenient access to downtown Chicago) to stay in a convenient suburbs rather than in Chicago or downtown Chicago. Since the ""Occupancy Tax"" is waived if you stay 31 days or longer, you can avoid this tax and save quite a bit of money if you plan your trip ahead and check with the host for room availability.

====== Other Information  ========
Cereal, waffles and coffee are provided by the host for the ARRIVAL day/night of the guests. A full service restaurant (Blue Max Cafe) is only a block north of the house (serves breakfast and lunch only). Various fast food and slow food restaurants are also very close.  A great oriental message service is just couple blocks south of the house (not too expensive, please get coupon from the host for one-time discount).

The house is the middle of Oak Park and Forest Park downtown (almost equal distance).  You have access to 24 hours super markets, and all sorts of other stores and entertainment in both downtown, plus big Chicago downtown of course. Come to stay in the house, and enjoy both the big Chicago, and friendly cute downtown in both Oak Park and Forest Park.",,,,,"NOTES:

I may also request identification to be displayed at the time of check-in if I feel your Airbnb photo does not match your appearance for the safety of all guests staying in my home. (please make sure you have a new photo uploaded to Airbnb to prevent any inconveniences at your check-in date. If you have a friend staying with you at my home please plan to check-in with your friends or meet up with them later to get your friends / family keys that will be staying at my home.

(Yes, I have had guests attempt to sneak in friends at night and I feel that this is unsafe for me so for that reason I have added this rule and the fine for violating the rules.)
4. (NO PACKAGES / NO MAIL / NO DELIVERIES) We will not accept packages or your mail to our address. You may not use our address for any sort of deliveries. If you have lost luggage in flight I can provide you my office address for the airlines to drop off your things the next day.

7. (NO ADDITIONAL CLEANING FEES UNLESS) Please be clean and make sure you wash your dishes and cups after use. If you create trash then you can throw it our yourself by going outside to the alley, If I find a mess (unwashed dishes, stains on the walls or floor) after your checkout there will be an additional cleaning fee taken from your security deposit (up to $200.00). I do not charge any extra cleaning fees if all guests have left the apartment and their room in the same condition as it was when they arrived at the check-in.
8. (RESPECT MY HOME) Please do not lay on sofa with shoes, Take your shoes off before entering rooms with carpet.

Any misuse of anything in the apartment and you will be responsible for the repair cost.
Do not flush anything down the toilet other than toilet paper, if a plumber is needed we will need to charge you. 
Sorry to be blunt but I can not keep paying out of pocket for sheets and towels that are destroyed while we share our home.
13. Please make sure that you notify us of anything that does not work or anything that you need changed (towels, linens) . We are your hosts, and we are here to help be the best that we can be for you.
14. Give us recommendations on anything you think we should change or do :) It helps me, trust me, it does. We have received many recommendations, and they have helped me vastly over the years.

MY FAMILY LIVES HERE TOO , let me know if you need anything .

Back of the Yards is an industrial and residential neighborhood so named because it was near the former Union Stock Yards, which employed thousands of European immigrants in the early 20th century. Life in this neighborhood was explored in Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel The Jungle. The area was formerly part of the town of Lake until it was annexed by Chicago in 1889. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the area was occupied largely by Eastern European immigrants and their descendants, who were predominantly ethnic Bohemian, Moravian, and Slovak.[2]

In the 1930s the activist Saul Alinsky did community organizing in this area, as its people suffered during the Great Depression. This work led to his founding the Industrial Areas Foundation in 1940, which trained community organizers.[3]

Jane Jacobs in her 1961 book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, cites the Back of the Yards as an area able to ""unslum"" in the 1960s, due to a beneficial set of circumstances. This included a stabilized community base with skilled members who were willing to trade work to upgrade housing, as well as active and well-led local social and political organizations. Jacobs often cited the Back of the Yards as a model for other depressed neighborhoods to follow to upgrade their communities.[4]

Some time after the 1970s, when the stockyard operations closed and the number of nearby jobs decreased, many people left to move to newer housing and work in the suburbs. The population of the neighborhood gradually reflected a new wave of settlement, predominantly Mexican-American.

Free Parking in front on the street!
We have a rental fleet available if you would like to rent one of our cars! You must book a car in advance two weeks before your reservation starts. Cars run about $25 to $45 per day extra.

We are easy going and looking for easy going happy travelers. If you are not easy going and friendly please do not stay with us :)","I realize that there are many rules, I have created them to make it safe for all guests. PLEASE READ ALL RULES so that you have a good stay :)
1.(ALL GUESTS MUST HAVE A GOVERNMENT ISSUED ID BEFORE MAKING A RESERVATION WITH US FOR SECURITY REASONS) If your reservation is for (2 occupants) I will require full names of all occupants that will occupy my home. I may also request identification to be displayed at the time of check-in if I feel your Airbnb photo does not match your appearance for the safety of all guests staying in my home. (please make sure you have a new photo uploaded to Airbnb to prevent any inconveniences at your check-in date. If you have a friend staying with you at my home please plan to check-in with your friends or meet up with them later to get your friends / family keys that will be staying at my home. 
2. (KEYS)  If your locked out of the apartment and I am required to take off work to meet you to let you in there will be a lockout fee of ($75.00).
3. NO UNAUTHORIZED GUESTS will be permitted INSIDE my home FOR ANY REASON. This is my home and I will not allow anyone to “VISIT YOU” while you are in Chicago. If you would like to meet up with friends then you can coordinate a meeting at a public place. ANY unauthorized guest in my home and you will be charged a UNAUTHORIZED GUEST fee of ($500) dollars per day they are in apartment for the entire stay from your security deposit if they are not disclosed earlier on AirBNB and I have permitted your guests prior to your payment for your reservation. (Yes, I have had guests attempt to sneak in friends at night and I feel that this is unsafe for me so for that reason I have added this rule and the fine for violating the rules.)
4. (NO PACKAGES / NO MAIL / NO DELIVERIES) We will not accept packages or your mail to our address. You may not use our address for any sort of deliveries. If you have lost luggage in flight I can provide you my office address for the airlines to drop off your things the next day.

7. (NO ADDITIONAL CLEANING FEES UNLESS) Please be clean and make sure you wash your dishes and cups after use. If you create trash then you can throw it our yourself by going outside to the alley, If I find a mess (unwashed dishes, stains on the walls or floor) after your checkout there will be an additional cleaning fee taken from your security deposit (up to $200.00). I do not charge any extra cleaning fees if all guests have left the apartment and their room in the same condition as it was when they arrived at the check-in.
8. (RESPECT MY HOME) Please do not lay on sofa with shoes, Take your shoes off before entering rooms with carpet.

The perfect location for a weekend getaway or business trip. River North is a stylish urban neighborhood that borders the Magnificent Mile and is just across the bridge from the Loop, Millennium Park, and the downtown theater district. It is the go-to neighborhood for those who appreciate fine art and design, but is also a little quieter than being right in the middle of downtown. For those who appreciate fine dining and drinks, you can find everything from knockout noodles and Spanish small plates to high-end steakhouses and famed pizzerias. Just about every type of cuisine is covered in this mix of award-winning restaurants and local favorites.

Lake Michigan beaches, Lincoln Park Zoo, Wrigley Field and many other attractions are a short bike or train ride away. The rapid transit train system provides a quick trip to downtown Chicago.

This cozy, charming apartment is located in the front of a classic vintage 3-flat building on a tree-lined street. The space is approximately 350 square feet and sits three steps down from the ground floor facing the front garden. Although it’s a studio apartment the layout has a multi-room feel. We have a lovely garden and patio in the backyard that’s available and accessible to guests. The kitchenette is equipped with a refrigerator, toaster, coffeemaker, electric kettle and a microwave for your convenience. There’s always a fresh supply of coffee and tea along with some snacks. The building is owner-occupied. We live on a quiet residential street but our neighborhood is loaded with things to do. It’s a walker’s paradise! Enjoy all that our city has to offer!

I live in the building and work nearby so I'm available in-person or via phone at any time. I'm a lifelong Chicagoan and have been in this building for over 30 years.

Our location is an 8 minute walk from the CTA train line where you can catch the Red Line or the Brown Line trains. Those will get you downtown, to Wrigley Field or numerous other locations that travelers would be drawn to. Less than a block away is a Divvy bicycle station where you can rent a bike for a half hour or the entire day. The Fullerton Bus can be accessed right around the corner from our street. For those with a car we'll provide zoned parking passes and there are always spots open on our street.","No cooking on the premises

Check-In Rules:
Unfortunately, I will not always be able to personally meet all guests at their desired check in time.

If I'm unable to meet you, I'll provide the Digital Door Lock Code with very detailed instructions for entry which will be messaged through Airbnb messenger at your Check-In time. You'll be given instant access to the building whenever you arrive! Please TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF upon entering the home. 

Food and Beverages:
There is absolutely NO consumption of food or beverages (excluding water) outside of the kitchen, kitchen bar, and dining room.

All food and beverages in the fridge and kitchen cabinets belong to other guests and your host. Refrain from taking food/beverages that were not brought in or purchased by you. Coffee, creamer, and sugar on the coffee bar in the kitchen are complimentary and you may have as much of it as you'd like. 

Guest Policy:
""Guest"" constitutes any person entering the property, whether spending the night or only visiting. Unverified, unauthorized guests are not allowed on the premises. If you'd like to have a guest during your stay, your guest MUST be verified and announced through the AirBnb messenger and approval of this guest must be explicitly given by us, the hosts. Violation of this rule will result in immediate cancellation of your reservation and termination of your stay. 

Mail:
Please notify the host if you want to have Mail/Parcels shipped to you during your stay.

Quiet Hours:
Quiet Hours at the residence are between the hours of 10pm and 7am Sunday-Thursday and 12am and 7am on Friday-Saturday.

This is a Shared Space with many Travelers all visiting Chicago for a different purpose.  Having common courtesy is more than enough to fulfill this rule.  If you're a Late Night personality, please respect those waking up early for work.  If you're up at the crack of dawn, please get ready as quietly as possible as to not disturb those still asleep.

Smoking:
There is absolutely no smoking inside of the building.  This includes Electronic Cigarettes and all other forms of Tobacco.

Travelers are more than welcome to Smoke outside of the building.  


Weapons:
Absolutely NO WEAPONS of any sort are allowed inside of the building.  This includes Firearms, Knives, and anything else that can be used in a malicious manner.  Host(s) will have Final Say in what constitutes as a weapon.

Violence:
There will be no violence of any sort tolerated inside of the building.  This includes Physical Violence, Verbal (Arguing, Threats, Intimidation, etc.), and any sort of behavior that causes another person in the house to feel upset. 

‘Common Sense’ Rule:
As this is a Shared Building, guests are expected to act in a way which is both Respectful and Inviting to everyone else sharing the space.   Actions which are deemed to have a Negative Impact on the overall experience of the other travelers will not be tolerated.  A few examples of this would be:  Leaving Dishes unwashed in the sink, being excessively messy or loud, or just having a negative, unwelcoming attitude.  If Behavior is causing other Travelers to feel uncomfortable, we will ask you to make necessary corrections, if these corrections are not made, we will terminate your stay.

Illegal Activity:
Any action which is in violation of any law within the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois is grounds for instant Termination


Check-Out Rules:

I have a Superhost status on Airbnb. You can book my property with confidence knowing so many before you truly enjoy their stay and left five star feedback. You can be assured that all amenities will be as described and I am always around to help with anything needed.

Hip Wicker Park has been a residential enclave since Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837. North Milwaukee Avenue is known for its bustling nightlife, dining and entertainment venues, with Subterranean and Davenport’s setting the bar for the city's trendy music clubs. North Damen Avenue draws hip crowds with its quirky shops, minimalist cafes, specialty grocery stores and cool fashion boutiques.
The Bloomingdale Line was a 2.7-mile (4.3 km) elevated railroad running east-west on the northwest side of Chicago. In 2015, the City of Chicago converted it into an elevated greenway called The Bloomingdale Trail, which forms the backbone of the linear park and trail network called The 606.

Two blue line stops within walking distance. This line is direct to the O'Hare airport and to downtown. Grocery store across the street, farmacy a few blocks away.

IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON HAVING A CELEBRATION: Unregistered guests are not allowed on the property. Presence of more than 18 guests is unlawful. A guest is anyone at the property, staying the night or just visiting. There is a counter installed and police will be notified immediately. This is not a place for a local house party. 

CONSIDER PURCHASING MY WORRY FREE CLEANING PACKAGE: For those of you traveling to Chicago to celebrate together: for additional $100 you do not have to clean anything. Just walk out in the morning (you do need to move furniture back if you make any changes to lay out). Note that this fee is additional to my regular cleaning fee.

Absolutely no illegal activity will be tolerated. If these rules are not observed, authorities will be notified immediately.
City of Chicago requires hosts to identify all guests. Each guest will need to present ID at check in and copy will be made. For one night reservations the entire group needs to be present in order to check in.
This is a neighborhood residential street. All noise needs to remain inside the unit and quite hours observed.
There is absolutely no smoking anywhere inside the house or outside close enough the doors or windows so that the house has even a faint smell of smoke. $500 will be charged from the security deposit should we detect ANY signs of smoking.",I have a Superhost status on Airbnb.

Anchored by a beautiful stretch of shoreline to the east and dotted with train stops from two ‘L' lines, Lakeview is one of Chicago's liveliest and most accessible neighborhoods. Several distinct areas — East Lakeview, Central Lakeview, Boystown and Wrigleyville — meld together to form a lakefront community that celebrates diversity and boasts something for every type of visitor.
Hit the bustling commercial districts along Belmont Avenue, Lincoln Avenue, Southport Avenue, Clark Street, Halsted Street and Broadway Street to shop — be it for vintage frocks, designer jeans or leather biker gear — or live it up with the locals at the seemingly endless options for bars and pubs, and the dozens of celebrated restaurants in between.

Arts and culture come in the form of live music venues, several summer street festivals and a thriving scene for theater, dance and comedy (Belmont Theater District is a stellar collection of nearly 20 independent companies).

Not to be outdone by its extraordinary entertainment landscape, Lakeview makes full use of its slice of Lincoln Park, a 1,200-acre oasis dedicated to the outdoors. Here you will find the scenic Lakefront Trail, a golf course and driving range, a boat harbor, a bird sanctuary, tennis courts and grassy playing fields that are also perfect for picnics or just soaking in the views.

Just steps away from public transportation! For all else, Uber, taxis, and the citys shared bike program, Divvy, are all accessible in the immediate area!","Very simply, please respect my home and my neighbors.

We do not have a lot of privacy here unless you book a private room and on any given day there will be between 10 and 15 people among all three floors and two bathrooms.  If communal living and sharing spaces with other people is a problem for you, please seek out alternative accommodations.

If you DO find anything out of place or needing replacement like food, toilet paper or similar, we are very responsive through messaging.  We do twice daily walk throughs but it only takes one guest to mess something up and unless you tell us we wont catch it until our next scheduled walk through.  

We schedule by appointment between 2pm and midnight.  If you do not set an appointment, you agree and understand that you may have to wait up to 4 hours past the time you wish to check in due to letting us know within 24 hours of your check in.

This includes check-ins requested after midnight as this is outside our normal check-in window. Delayed flights or bus situations are exempt from this.  

We can usually meet 99% of our guests at the time of their choosing assuming they let us know 24 hours or more in advance.  Those we cannot are offered some type of compensation or a full refund if they wish to cancel.

Alterations or arriving late to check in times may be subject to a 15 per hour charge to pay an employee to sit around and wait for you.  In some cases, you may have to wait for a few hours for someone to be free to check you in if you change your time last minute to go explore, eat, drink, or visit friends.  

 If you have provided your flight/train/bus information and we can confirm it was delayed no charges will apply for being late and we’ll make it work.  



Quiet time is after 10pm.  What this means is the upstairs common area is off limits if there are guests.  If you or the other group in your bedroom is trying to sleep you are obligated to be quiet, do not turn on lights, do not use your cell phones or laptops.  You can do this in the first floor in our 24 hour common area.  This kitchen on the first floor may also be used for cooking during quiet hours if you are quiet about it.  The upstairs kitchen is off limits from 10pm to 8am so as to not wake guests in the living room.


Dishes are placed into the dish rack.  If there is no room in the dish rack, please put enough dishes away to fit yours, and then put yours in the dish rack.

We schedule by appointment between 2pm and midnight.  If you do not set an appointment, you agree and understand that you may have to wait up to 4 hours past the time you wish to check in due to letting us know within 24 hours of your check in.  

In addition, if you fail to meet your scheduled appointment time you may be charged 15 dollars per hour pro rated in order for an employee to sit and wait for you.

Alterations or arriving late to check in times may be subject to a 15 per hour charge to pay an employee to sit around and wait for you.  In some cases, you may have to wait for a few hours for someone to be free to check you in if you change your time last minute to go explore, eat, drink, or visit friends.  

 If you have provided your flight/train/bus information and we can confirm it was delayed no charges will apply for being late and we’ll make it work.  



Quiet time is after 10pm.  What this means is the upstairs common area is off limits if there are guests.

You can do this in the first floor in our 24 hour common area.  This kitchen on the first floor may also be used for cooking during quiet hours if you are quiet about it.  The upstairs kitchen is off limits from 10pm to 8am so as to not wake guests in the living room.

“ Rogers Park is one of Chicago’s most diverse neighborhoods, with approximately 40 different languages spoken. As you might expect, the neighborhood’s dining options are just as diverse. The area’s restaurants will take you on a journey from Mexico to Peru, Jamaica to Ethiopia, Korea to the Middle East, and beyond.
If you want a taste of Chicago’s artsy side, Rogers Park is the perfect place to be. Check out the Glenwood Avenue Arts District, an inviting urban stretch with cobblestone streets, sprawling murals, three award-winning theatres, live music venues, art studios and galleries, and more.
Head east until you hit the water to see the neighborhood’s sandy shoreline and peaceful waterfront vistas. Near the lake, you’ll find the Emil Bach House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Completed in 1915, it was one of Wright’s last Chicago commissions. Architecture buffs can even book an overnight stay “

You are staying in my former beloved park side home. My trusted friend Alexander lives in the downstairs garden unit and is on call for any smaller needs you may have.

McKinley Park has long been a working-class area throughout its history.  Two blocks to the south along Pershing is the historic Central Manufacturing District. It has been described as the United States' first planned industrial district and features some surprisingly decorative warehouses from the turn of the century as well as an old clock tower. The juxtaposition of a city park on one side of Pershing with old huge seven story warehouses on the other is incredibly unique and worth scoping out.

The McKinley Park neighborhood is more of a quiet refuge from the night life scenes Chicago has to offer. You'll have to venture a little further for restaurants or bars. Pilsen to the north and Brideport to the east are excellent destinations for restaurants and Chicago's China town is a quick trip down the Orange line.

The nearest grocery market is three blocks to the north at Damen and Archer Ave.

The walk to the Orange Line stop is mostly park side and through family oriented city residential blocks all of which are well lit at night. The #9 Ashland ave and #49 Western ave buses both a quick walk to operate 24 hours and cover much of the city north to south.  Street parking is available most of the time especially one block south on Damen. There is also a Divvy bike share station about 2 blocks away.

The building is 132 years strong. With all the vintage charm comes a few squeaky floor boards.

Being an older building you may hear the other floors on occasion and hear guests going up the stairs.

It's overall a quiet building and I ask that you respect upstairs guests and downstairs tenant. Parties will not be tollerated here.

There is a 8 step porch to gain access to this apartnent.",- Please respect the guests upstairs!,You are staying in my former beloved park side home.

Because the universe is kind, we're a show-house for the Jennifer Norback gallery, so brace yourself for some insanely cool art. The place has a good vibe. 

The kid's room has one twin bed. My room has a totally dreamy king-size pillow top bed, the same kind they use at the Four Seasons. Both bedrooms have full bathrooms. 

Our pad is walking distance to the Lincoln Park Zoo, Wrigley Field, museums, and tons of great playgrounds, restaurants, shops, bars, gyms, comedy clubs and theaters, and a weekly farmer's market. The best part is the park and harbor just across the street--miles of lakefront, perfect for a morning run or a late night stroll. 

Some nights, our entire apartment can be booked for $450; other nights, we're game to share for $130. 

Promise, promise, it's all good.

Sometimes will be staying nearby, sometimes not. If we're in town, we're happy to share a meal, leave you alone, or point you in the right direction.

East Lakeview/Boystown is eclectic neighborhood is a vibrant mix of hipsters, families, socialites, buskers, orthodox Jews, and gays, with just enough heart and grit to make you feel good about living in the city. Plus, we have the best gelato, cupcakes, falafel and fried Korean chicken in Chicago, hands-down.

Hop a five minute cab or the 146 express buss to downtown and the loop right out our front door. The Belmont stop El train (brown/red line) is a ten minute walk away. Hail a cab right out front in minutes. Parking is a big drag in my neighborhood, so skip the rental car. I don't own a car and happily get around on foot, cab, or bus. If you are driving, there's street parking and  a public lot just a block away (Broadway and Roscoe).

There's a Divvy bike station right outside my building. If the weather's nice, grab a bike and ride downtown along the lake or explore any of Chicago's great neighborhoods.","No pets, no smoking. 
As much as we love fun and games, no parties or extra guests who are not listed in the original booking.
--no shoes in the house
--please refrain from wearing strong perfumes and colognes 
--use place mats on the dining room table, especially for water glasses
--Before leaving, please change the sheets and towels and empty the garbage.
Be nice.","Sometimes will be staying nearby, sometimes not.

FieldHouse Jones is located in the River North neighborhood of Chicago.  Geographically speaking, it’s the area just north of the Chicago River, hence the name.  It’s home to most of Chicago’s heavy hitters like Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, the John Hancock Building, Merchandise Mart, and the Museum of Contemporary Art to name a few.  Anyone that has come to Chicago to see its main tourist attractions has definitely come through this part of town.  But don’t let the high concentration of tourist destinations fool you.

But know that it does not run from 1am to 5am.  The Red Line is about four blocks away and basically runs up and down Lake Michigan.  Also, unlike, the Brown Line, it runs all the time.

The property is conveniently located on Grand Avenue in the Ukrainian Village just minutes by car, bus or train from Downtown and the Lakefront.

Catering to the discerning sports fan and concert goer the United Center is a 5 minute Uber ride door to door!

The theme is based on the Championship teams that played at the Madhouse on Madison. Formerly The Chicago Stadium now flying under the disguise of The United Center. Obviously there is one player from those Bulls teams that is known the world over and he is prominently featured in the living room here, MJ!

The apartment has all the comforts of home. 55"" Samsung LED TV for watching sports, movies, or catching up on your favorite shows. Additionally you have access to Xfinity stream pics, Netflix, Bluetooth Sound, and high speed internet.

Plenty of places to relax throughout. Chill on the oversized couch or grab a cocktail at the bar. The kitchen is fully equipped for cooking and there is seating to eat in both the Kitchen and Dining Room.

There are three Bedrooms for sleeping and for overflow guests there is a Queensized  air mattress. The extra large couch can easily sleep 2 more guests should you need the space.

Hosts Brad and Darin are very easy to reach and knowledgeable on the City. Both live in the area and are great guides for local restaurants, bars, amusements, and shops. They are happy to show you around personally, or leave you to explore the awesome neighborhood and city on your own. Both always available by phone 24/7.

There is a reason this neighborhood is rated one of the best in the country. Only about half a square mile, Ukrainian Village manages to serve as a shopping hub, hipster haven, cozy neighborhood for the stroller set, and, yes, outpost for immigrants from Ukraine. As you wander along Chicago Avenue, you’ll see storefront signs in Ukrainian, no English in sight, even though the original population has dwindled to a couple of thousand from its one-time high of around 30,000. Indeed, the rest of the city has discovered the well-maintained housing stock and double-wide sidewalks of Division Street—welcoming features that in 1983 prompted Mayor Jane Byrne to designate Ukrainian Village an official neighborhood, the first in Chicago.

We are a short ride via the Milwaukee North Metra line non-stop to Downtown. The Metra is a 2 minute walk from the front door. There is also a Divvy Bike rental located at the Metra stop and there is a new electric scooter program in the City.

Plenty of street parking abounds and Uber and Lyft will typically be at the front door in 2-3 Minutes.

If Navy Pier is your destination you can catch the 65 Grand Bus right out front direct, with no changes.

For stays with children under 2 yrs old: The unit is not ""baby proofed"" but is suitable for small children if under constant supervision.

I want to preface the following by saying 95% of our guests leave our places in amazing condition. We are very understanding about small messes that may have been overlooked as I know I am by no means perfect. That being said the following is to address the 5% who may not understand quite how airbnb works yet. 
1. We are not a hotel. 
2. We are not your personal maids. 

While there is a cleaning fee, the fee is to cover changing of linens, washing of towels and ""normal"" cleaning of the kitchen, bathroom and living areas. What is not covered and WILL incur an extra fee are the following: 

1. A pile of dishes left in the sink (violates house rules)
2. Excessive kitchen messes such as cooking grease all over the stove.
3. Excessive food on the floors (I dont mean a few crumbs-I mean it looked like someone was feeding pigeons).
4. Chewing gum ground into the furniture (yes, that has actually happened).
5. OBVIOUS wearing of shoes in the unit (we are a no-shoes house- see house rules) ie shoes foot prints, tracked in dirt and mud.
5. Anything else above and beyond what is considered ""normal"" cleaning. 
6. smoking in the unit will AUTOMATICALLY  incur a $200 fee. 

Again- this ISNT the majority of our guests and we understand things can be overlooked. Upon an ""excessive cleaning"" situation, I will not leave any review, I will simply send a request for an extra cleaning fee (usually around $25-50) depending on how much extra time it took to clean.

Nestled in the heart of Oak Park's oldest neighborhood, our property has Oak Park's original Oak trees.  The people and the neighborhood are unbeatable. It's a great place for families to stay or friends to meet. Our place is where you visit when you visit Oak Park.

What makes our space's location unique is it's urban yet quiet appeal of a Village neighborhood.  This is 2 story home has plenty of spaces for privacy or large gatherings.  The house sleeps 9-12, the back garden is gorgeous and perfect for hosting friends and family, and the privacy and discretion can't be beat.  We are 5-star hosts managing five owned Airbnb with extremely high ratings.  This newest listing is the one to grab!

Outdoors:
There is a back porch that's great for evening sit outs under alfresco evening lighting.  There is a playground for children to play and plenty of space to have a cook out, play games, or catch fire flies in the summer time.  It really is a special place and we hope you enjoy it.

There is one parking spot provided but we can accommodate more than one vehicle with advance notice and preparation.

The 2-story private living space of the home is available to guests,  Access to the basement is for owners use only.

We are all for privacy and simplicity.  If you want self check-in, it's available to you.  If you prefer, we're happy to check you in and out and will always be available to provide information about the area.  We own this home and live in Oak Park the property itself has direct access to the historic Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio. If you'd like interaction with us, we're here.  If not, the distance from our house (next door) makes 'distancing yourself' a fairly easy goal to achieve. :-)

Our space is centrally located amongst Oak Park’s largest and most historic homes.  We love everything about this neighborhood; it's quiet, all of the homes are +100 years old and meticulously kept.  This home is next door to the acclaimed Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio grounds. The original settlers of Oak Park (the Kettlestrings) lived around the corner from our home, so taking a walk in our neighborhood is like taking a stroll back through history.

We are four blocks away from centralized el/subway and we are a 15-20 minute train ride to Chicago's State Street. If you're driving, we are also a short distance away from the Eisenhower Expressway (I-290) and thus a short drive to Michigan Ave in Chicago.  Cabs are also easily accessible as we live only steps away from FLW Home and Studio where there is a cab stand.

There is a spacious garden, basketball hoop, children's toys, a tree swing and full playground which guests will have full access to.  The outdoor space is shared with homeowners and other guests for the guest house above the garage. The grille and fire pits are available upon request and in the summer months.  

The basement to the home is locked at all times from inside with owner-only access to be used during the day for Airbnb staging.  All doors and windows are alarmed and will sound when opened.  

We are casual hosts, we enjoy a carefree lifestyle and often enjoy taking walks in our neighborhood.  Come be our guest.","AM events may be OK with additional information - parties in any form are not allowed.
One parking spots available (two upon request), shared backyard with my family and coach house guests, so you must be comfortable that we may be present. 
Quiet hours after 10pm during week days (after Sept 1), 11pm on weekends","We are all for privacy and simplicity.  If you want self check-in, it's available to you.

Just 5 miles from downtown, Roscoe Village is a charming, laidback “village within the city” filled with casual taverns, independent shops, and cute cafes that spill out onto the sidewalks during the warm weather months. This cozy little pocket is an eclectic mix of unique boutiques, classic frame and brick homes, and locally owned eateries. It’s a wonderfully welcoming and quirky place. Case in point: popular comfort food spot Kitsch’n on Roscoe, where you can enjoy your brunch with a side of ’70’s-style kitsch. Check out Le Sud’s rooftop patio, where you can soak in the sun and laidback vibes with some French Mediterranean dishes. Come evening, head to Constellation, where you’ll find some of the city’s most progressive jazz, contemporary classical, and improvised music, founded by local drummer and Pitchfork Music Festival’s talent buyer. Shop a vintage clothing goldmine at Shangri-La Vintage. Get a free tasting on Sundays at Lush Wine & Spirits. Enjoy seasonal small plates and an approachable wine list on Volo Restaurant Wine Bar’s intimate, year-round patio.

The McCormick Place Convention Center is just 20 minutes by train.

Close to lakefront, beaches, stadiums and Hyde Park. University of Chicago, IIT, UIC and Loop campuses are nearby.

We offer a one bedroom in a large, luxurious condo located in a hip, up-and-coming neighborhood with culture and soul near the Chicago Loop. Includes free parking, WiFi and washer/dryer access.

You'll enjoy the privacy and comfort of your own bedroom, a fully-equipped modern kitchen and full access to the dining and living rooms. Long-term stays are available as well. 

There may be additional guests staying in the other bedrooms during your stay which is great for meeting new people and networking. Essentially, we offer guests the convenience of a boutique hotel while providing the comfort of home. 

We're just a mile away from Chicago's lakefront, providing great bike trails, running paths, beaches and gardens, not to mention views of one of the world's most scenic waterfront skylines. Of course, we're conveniently situated for business travelers attending conventions at McCormick Place or meetings with major corporations downtown, as well as institutions of higher learning, such as IIT, UIC, Northwestern and the University of Chicago, both the downtown and Hyde Park campuses.

Getting around is easy as we're only a block away from the public transit stop. There, you can catch the train that'll take you directly downtown in minutes or you can transfer to other trains for connecting to all parts of the city, including both airports. 

If you have a car there is ample, free street parking and the Loop is only a 10 minute drive. In addition to the train, we highly recommend rideshare services from either Uber or Lyft, which are very economically priced from our place for getting around the city.

This is a great place for you if you'd like to be close to the energy of Chicago's vibrant Loop but want to experience a unique, local neighborhood.

Guests have complete access to our modern, fully-equipped kitchen so long as it's kept clean after each use.

Our secure building’s doors are only accessible with a key fob, so make sure to bring the key fob with you anytime you leave the apartment.","Searching for a quiet urban oasis in the Windy City? Look no further than our sunny, professionally decorated apartment in the heart of Chicago’s Edgewater neighborhood. 

Comfortably accommodating up to 5 guests for business or pleasure, our apartment includes a spacious living room, a fully equipped kitchen, and laundry room.

What’s better than an apartment smack-dab in the middle of the Windy City? How about your own place that’s just minutes outside of the downtown hustle and bustle so you can enjoy the best that Chicago has to offer AND get a good night’s sleep?

Welcome to our sunny oasis in Edgewater, a charming neighborhood slightly north of Downtown Chicago, and just a few stops from Loyola University, Evanston, the Magnificent Mile, and Grant Park via the Red Line train. Edgewater is blocks from Lake Michigan, which you can enjoy via numerous nearby beaches and the scenic Lakefront Trail.

Our one-bedroom apartment features two plush Queen-size beds, complete with premium linens and plenty of pillows. The private bedroom has a large window and ample closet space so you can unpack and make yourself at home. And in the living room, our couch unfolds into a Queen-size sofa bed to accommodate additional guests. It’s no normal sofa bed - it’s actually really comfortable!

Our one full bathroom is complete with fluffy towels, complimentary toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, and soap), and a hairdryer. It has a shower/tub combo, toilet, and sink with storage above and below.

Thanks to our open floor plan, the living room, and kitchen create one big living space, where you can whip up a gourmet meal, kick back with a movie, or just chill out with your travel companions. The living room’s 49-inch flat-screen TV has unlimited Netflix streaming and the entire place has fast WiFi. Throughout the apartment, you’ll find modern decor and stylish furniture which has been chosen by our professional designer - so we can’t take all the credit! 

In the kitchen, we have stocked the cupboards with all of the dishes, cookware, and utensils you’d need to cook up a storm. Appliances include a full-size refrigerator and freezer, stove, oven, dishwasher, Keurig coffee maker, and toaster. It’s seriously Top Chef-worthy, so feel free to hit up the nearby Target or Aldi for groceries and fill up the fridge.

Need to do some laundry or burn off last night’s deep-dish? Our building has a laundry room that you’re welcome to use at any time. And while parking is not included with our place, there is street parking available nearby.

In addition to full access to the apartment, you’ll also enjoy the building’s amenities. Feel free to use the laundry room (just BYO detergent and quarters), lobby lounge area, and the sunny patio. 

Our secure building’s doors are only accessible with a key fob, so make sure to bring the key fob with you anytime you leave the apartment.

We’re all about giving you plenty of privacy and personal space, so we’ll be available by phone (call or text) during your stay.

Our unit is on the 4th floor of a building full of other apartments, and you can access it via the elevator. The front doors are locked at all times and access is granted with a key fob.

We highly recommend keeping your key fob in a safe place, because if you lose it, you’ll lose access to the entire building. Not fun. It takes time to replace it, which means you might be locked out of the building and the apartment for a while, and any fob replacement will incur a fee of $300. That’s probably not what you have in mind for a “memorable” trip to Chicago, so let’s just keep track of the fob.

Our apartment includes lots of awesome amenities, but it does NOT include a parking space. If you need to park a vehicle, there is some metered street parking nearby. We recommend using the Spot Hero app to claim a street parking space. The city is easily accessible with public transit and ridesharing, so having your own set of wheels isn’t necessary unless you plan on exploring far outside the city limits.

Our building has strict rules, so please don’t do anything illegal (this includes marijuana smoking). And our neighbors can (and have!) called the police on any illegal activities.
We know you want to jump up and down and shout about how awesome Chicago is, but our building has strict noise limits. No loud music, no parties, and there will be no problems.

Smoking is NOT allowed in our apartment. Any smoke in the unit will result in having your reservation cancelled and a $200 fee assessed for cleaning and restoring our place to its smoke-free condition.

Thank you for understanding, and we look forward to hosting you!

If you prefer to not worry about a possible run-in with a meter maid or an overpriced parking garage, we recommend utilizing Chicago’s awesome public transportation system (the CTA train and bus) to get around the city. 

The Windy City is also extremely walkable, and when you stroll down the Lakefront Trail, you just might find your own two legs taking you all the way to the South Side. Or, take a spin on two wheels using one of Chicago’s bike-sharing programs, like Divvy.

Our place is a quick 4-minute walk to Bryn Mawr Station, where you can hop on the Red Line, which will take you all the way north to Loyola and south to Wrigley Field and Downtown Chicago. At Howard Station (a 10-minute ride north), the Red Line turns into the Purple Line, which continues to Evanston and Northwestern University.

Ridesharing is also an option, and both Uber and Lyft are available throughout the Chicago metro. During morning and evening rush hours - and during popular events - remember that Downtown Chicago can get filled with traffic and fares may increase.

-Access to the unit is through an elevator 

-There are many units inside this building.

There is limited street parking. I recommend using ""spot hero"" app and claim parking near by for your stay. You can access the whole city through the CTA train near by.

NO SMOKING IN THE UNIT. $200 fine + cleaning fees.

1. Please NO SHOES in the unit.
2. Please wash any dishes you use. There will be a $25 fee for more than just a handful of dishes left behind.
3. Parties and events have to be cleared PRIOR to your stay. IF YOU ARE TRYING TO BE SLICK AND THROW A PARTY AND/OR THEN TRY TO CANCEL: I WILL KEEP WHATEVER MONEY YOU PAY PER THE CANCELLATION POLICY. 
4. No smoking
5. No pets. I do have other units available that accept pets.
6. smoking in the unit will AUTOMATICALLY  incur a $200 fee. 

I want to preface the following by saying 95% of our guests leave our places in amazing condition. We are very understanding about small messes that may have been overlooked as I know I am by no means perfect. That being said the following is to address the 5% who may not understand quite how airbnb works yet. 
1. We are not a hotel. 
2. We are not your personal maids. 

While there is a cleaning fee, the fee is to cover changing of linens, washing of towels and ""normal"" cleaning of the kitchen, bathroom and living areas. What is not covered and WILL incur an extra fee are the following: 

1. A pile of dishes left in the sink (violates house rules)
2. Excessive kitchen messes such as cooking grease all over the stove.
3. Excessive food on the floors (I dont mean a few crumbs-I mean it looked like someone was feeding pigeons).
4. Chewing gum ground into the furniture (yes, that has actually happened).
5. OBVIOUS wearing of shoes in the unit (we are a no-shoes house- see house rules) ie shoes foot prints, tracked in dirt and mud.
5. Anything else above and beyond what is considered ""normal"" cleaning. 

Again- this ISNT the majority of our guests and we understand things can be overlooked. Upon an ""excessive cleaning"" situation, I will not leave any review, I will simply send a request for an extra cleaning fee (usually around $25-50) depending on how much extra time it took to clean.

Wrigleyville / Boystown is the lively little pocket in the Lakeview neighborhood that sits in the shadows of historic Wrigley Field, the second oldest stadium in baseball and home to the beloved Chicago Cubs. It has become a magnet for sports fans and young professionals alike, and particularly singles who hop from bar to bar along Clark, Addison and Sheffield Avenues.

We're steps to the Sheridan red line station, and near multiple bus lines.

As an extra benefit, my home is very close to one of Chicago's iconic 'L' lines. While extremely convenient for getting around the City, you may hear the trains come by on occasion.

Deck and yard: feel free to use the deck with morning coffee or afternoon happy hour. Just be mindful of the neighbors please.

We are available as much as guests would like and will always respect their privacy.

Super transportation options, good bakeries, bars and restaurants in easy walking distance to our home. Try Janik's on Division Street for breakfast!  Tree lined streets and nice homes in our area make this a desirable and walkable neighborhood. (You are in the East Village of Wicker Park!) We are located between two grocery stores: Jewel's and Mariano's with ready cooked meals if you want to save $. You are in walking distance to the actual Wicker Park with great eateries and bars nearby, if you prefer to eat out .You can easily get to the 606 walking/biking trail or take transit/taxi to Ukrainian Village, Logan Square, Bucktown, Lincoln Park, Wrigleyville, the Loop, Water Tower/Michigan Avenue, Chinatown, and many great areas in our city. So much to see and do here, with our world class museums, sports teams, high end shopping and cuisine.

Again - so much choice!Great transit starting with the Division station on the Blue line and therefore 3 stops away from downtown (at Washington). 66 Chicago Ave bus takes you to Navy Pier. 56 Milwaukee and 70 Division street buses are also options,a bit on the slow side, but scenic rides. There's a Divvy bike station very close by on Augusta. Uber and Lyft are easy options for door to door service. Regular taxis are still operating very frequently in our area. You can try hailing them on Division or you can call one. There's a taxi stand at the corner of Milwaukee, Ashland and Division so after your Alliance Bakery or Starbucks excursion, you can walk east about 5-10 minutes to find a cab or the Blue Line station or any of those buses previously mentioned.

Parking: driveway fits two cars off street. $10 per car per night. Payment due at check in via PayPal or Venmo","Please don't wake the neighbors on Fri/Sat/Sun after 11:30pm, weekdays after 10:00pm

The great thing about our house is that it is in a quiet,  safe neighborhood that is 2 blocks from the CTA Blue Line Train which can take you directly to downtown Chicago or to O'Hare International Airport when you leave for easy travel (20 minutes to downtown, 29 minutes to O'Hare).   It is also close (2 blocks) to the expressway in case you are driving with extremely easy parking in front of the house  (a daily pass is required or you will receive a ticket as it is zoned parking - please let us know and we can provide a daily pass if needed).

Lots of natural light, open floorplan.  Perfect kitchen for preparing meals and entertaining.

Welcome to my private oasis in Chicago! 

This house was renovated  and everything is new! Your bedroom has a full-size bed, desk, large closet,  vaulted ceiling's, and ceiling fan.  There is a private bathroom for you to use just outside of the bedroom door.  A washing machine and dryer is also available next to the bedroom for your use. 

I live in the home with my 3 year old so there are plenty of toys, games, and baby items if you need them. There is a pack and play, highchair, stroller if needed.

There are hardwood floors throughout the house, and everything is decorated very neutral.  There is a large flat screen TV in the living room with Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Sling TV, HBO now, STARZ and Showtime. Also a blueray player, and there are built in surround sound speakers in the ceiling of the first floor.  There is a great gas fireplace that just requires the flip of the switch. The kitchen is large, perfect for entertaining and there are all the pots/pans/blender etc needed to cook a great meal.  There is a built in booth with a flat screen tv for use, and a gas Weber grill and a small charcoal grill on the back patio. 

No need to look for Chicago street parking here.  The home has a driveway that can accomodate 3 cars. Have a glass of wine on the front porch or a beer on the back patio with firepit for your enjoyment.  A tree was recently cut down so there is plenty of firewood to use. The home sits on a double lot, which gives you and your group plenty of space for activies in the yard.

The home features sling TV, Netflix, and Roku or Chromecast.  The Wi-Fi is quite fast, and very reliable. All sheets and towels are provided for you so there is no need to bring your own. This would be a pefect place for someone who needs temporary housing while relocating, or a perfect place for a short vacation to come and explore the city. 

Home features the famous ""Moustache Mirror"", try it out, take photo, and send to your friends! 

The  blue line train is the nearest stop and it'll take you straight downtown or to ohare airport.  If you are driving, this is a good location because it is near 90/94 to get in or out of the city very easily.   If you're planning on going to a Cubs game or spending time in Wrigleyville, the house is a two minute walk from Addison ave, you can hop on a bus there and go straight down the road to the bars, stadium, restaurants, etc.  Chicago is a very easy city to drive, and can get to the magnificant mile in 20 minutes.

Staying in our home, we will try to incorporate you as much as you wish into our family activities.  Some of our guests like to cook and dine with us, while others prefer to eat alone.  We respect whichever you choose, but always want you to know you are welcome to hang out with our little family.

We occasionally will watch a small to medium size dog.  The dog would not ever be in your personal bedroom or space, but in the common areas.","The Rules of the house are simple.  Treat it with respect and treat it like its your own.  No smoking in the house, no illegal drugs, and please clean up after yourself. :)  If you break something please replace it or let me know.","Staying in our home, we will try to incorporate you as much as you wish into our family activities.

Want to be out? You're a 5-10 minute walk to many great shops, restaurants and bars. We are 20 minutes to downtown via the Red line EL train, 5 minute walk to Wrigley Baseball Stadium, 7 minute walk to Southport Street where all the family restaurants and great shops are, and a 10 minute walk to Boys Town.  The Roscoe House is the perfect place for your stay in Chicago! 

Remember though, with all this great access to city fun- you will be in the city, which means you will hear the train pass behind the house (3 lots over) and if the windows are open, you might hear the neighbors. Most say that the train sounds like a nice woosh to lull you to sleep :)
Permit street parking is available (we can give you a permit), and of course we have wifi.

Please respect our neighbors as well-  they are great. The only parties allowed are OURS, but if you're nice...you're invited!

If you are looking for the formal experience you would enjoy in a hotel, Earphoria is not for you. We are for those that are more ""adventure travel"" oriented, who want to learn about the communities they pass through and be a part of the real Chicago arts scene. 

Earphoria is a single family home that offers couch surfing spaces in a shared space and one bathroom. There is a community kitchen, living room, dining area, finished basement, back yard and deck.

Earphoria offers:
- Complimentary bread, milk, eggs and condiments
- Full Kitchen Access
- Linens and Towels
- Wi-Fi 
- Free Washer and Dryer
- Family style breakfasts and dinners are often cooked by hosts, friends and guests of Hostel Earphoria. New guests are encouraged to participate. 
- We ask that each host and guest contribute by doing a daily chore.  
- Gated parking available on request.

We look forward to having you at our home!

(Pssst... Quick favor if you're thinking about booking: Please read the entire listing as it likely answers any questions you may have. Thanks!) 

To access the building, we give you a simple code to go in-and-out as you please. You walk up the stairs to the elevators, and take the elevator to the top floor, the 8th floor.

When you exit the elevator, you turn right and then left down the hallway to your home. When you enter the home, it opens to an open, spacious loft. There is a dining area, a kitchen, a living room, a half bathroom,and private patio for those staying on the first level. The private patio gives you a fresh feel and a cool cityscape view.

If you walk up to the 2nd floor, you will find a spacious loft with two full size beds, a huge closet, a full bathroom, and a half bathroom. This is truly a special place, and we look forward to making your stay a 5-star experience!

Q: Is the neighborhood safe?
A: Very much so. 24 hours a day.

Q: PARKING?
A: The home is very easy to get to via public transit. If you decide to drive, we recommend apps like SpotAngel or SpotHero to find free or cheap parking ($10-20 / night). 

Q: Do I need to bring towels, a hair dryer, or linens?
A: Nope! we provide all these things. Same with hotel-size toiletries (unless I happen to be out, which is rare).

Q: When can I check in or check out? 
A: Check in is 4pm and check out is 10am. Early check ins can be difficult if there are guests who checked out same day. We ask for an early check-in, or a late-check out fee, if you request either.

Q: Can I come and go as I please?
A: Yes. And we wouldn't trust any listing with which this isn't the case.

Q: Is the place professionally cleaned between guests?
A: Yes, and we take pride in providing a clean home for guests.

Q: What's my total booking price? 
A: We honestly have no idea. With fees included, it only shows the guest how much they pay. This figure should be present after you enter your dates. Note that, pricing varies on a daily basis, and it actually uses some crazy algorithm to adjust it automatically, so I don't actually control this.

Q: Are the beds comfortable?
A: Very. Some guests say they're the best they've ever slept on!

You have access to our whole home, the private balcony, and the full size gym on the ground floor.

We're here to help as you need it! We give all of our guests full itinerary for their trip 2 days before their stay.

Printers Row is “pocket” neighborhood just minutes from the Chicago Loop. After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the area became the Midwest hub of the printing industry with historically significant buildings designed by legendary architects like Daniel Burnham, William Holabird and William Le Baron Jenney. Today, many of those historic buildings remain but the quiet, tree lined streets are now largely residential. Of course, it continues to be a draw for fans of Chicago architecture.

During the day, the neighborhood is an easy walk to offices in the Loop, off Michigan Avenue, or in LaSalle Street financial centers. After hours, the district is alive with restaurants, boutiques, book and antique stores.

It boasts famous blues clubs, eclectic music venues and neighborhood taverns where residents gather. It also has an annual book fair: The Printers Row Book Fair gathers authors, poets, speakers and, of course, books.

Printer's Row is also walking distance to Chicago's Museum Campus, with the Field Museum, Adler Planetarium and Shedd Aquarium, and the newly redesigned Soldier Field.

With a 97 walk score and 100 transit score, you can get everywhere your heart desires in Chicago. The Red Line subway is one of the main subways in Chicago, and is only a block away. Many restaurants, shopping, parks, and museums are within walking distance.

This is a 7 bedroom, 3.5 bathrooms house in a quiet neighborhood. The space is well distributed with 2 kitchens, spacious dining and living rooms, a small family room, and an enclosed patio.

You will have access to the entire house, including the laundry room that is located in the lower level. The house has an enclosed back porch and an outdoor patio with a grill that can be used for outdoor cooking.

We keep a family environment. We share some times at dinner time when everyone makes it around the same time in the evening.  The kitchen and dining room are the main gathering place.  We share conversations about our cultures and journeys around the world. On weekends, sometimes people gather in the living room to watch a movie. On special occasions, we go out together.

My house is located in the center of the city about 30 minutes from downtown and 20 minutes from O'Hare Airport. There are many amenities in the nearby area, including restaurants, sports bars, museums, movie theatres, bowling alleys, and shopping stores.
Access to any part of the city or suburbs is easy because our CTA and RTA / city busses and train system are easy to manage. I always provide guests with the link to our transportation system so they can plan and track their daily trips. If you rent a car, I have easy street parking.

Close to all city entertainment via the Blue Line train and CTA bus system. 
My website also provides you with the link to the bus system tracker so you can be always informed about the bus schedule. The same is for the train system.

Directions to the house:
Your “home away from home” is located at the West end of the Logan Square community – across from the Belmont-Cragin neighborhood.  The area is clean, safe and easy to walk. You have a Walmart - 24 Walgreens – a gym facility, and other amenities few blocks from the house.

If you are arriving from O’Hare Airport:
Before you take the train, make sure to buy the VENTRA (transportation card).
You will save money buying a 1-week pass, even if you are going to be here for couple of days; otherwise you will pay $2.25 every time you board a bus or train.
If you are staying for 30 or more, buy the 1-month pass $100 + $5 for the card.  You will be able to reload the card, if you are going to stay longer.

From O’Hare:
Once you take the Blue Line train (the only one from the airport) it will take you about 20 min (depending on the time of the day) to arrive to the Irving Park Station.  Go down the stairs and take the bus #53 going South Pulaski (right) to George St.
Walk West (right) to the house.

From downtown Chicago:
Take the Blue Line – you have three options to come to the house:
In general, the trip will take about 35-40 minutes.
1 – Get off on Logan Square – take the bus #76 – get off on Pulaski – walk North pass the Fire Station and the Self Storage warehouse – make a left on George street to find the house.
2 – Get off on Kinball/Belmont Station – take bus #77 – get off on Pulaski – take bus #53 to George Street – walk West (right) to the house

Directions to the house:
Your “home away from home” is located at the West end of the Logan Square community – across from the Belmont-Cragin neighborhood.  The area is clean, safe and easy to walk. You have a Walmart - 24 Walgreens – a gym facility, and other amenities few blocks from the house.

If you are arriving from O’Hare Airport:
Before you take the train, make sure to buy the VENTRA (transportation card).
You will save money buying a 1-week pass, even if you are going to be here for couple of days; otherwise you will pay $2.25 every time you board a bus or train.
If you are staying for 30 or more, buy the 1-month pass $100 + $5 for the card.  You will be able to reload the card, if you are going to stay longer.

From O’Hare:
Once you take the Blue Line train (the only one from the airport) it will take you about 20 min (depending on the time of the day) to arrive to the Irving Park Station.  Go down the stairs and take the bus #53 going South Pulaski (right) to George St.
Walk West (right) to the house.

From downtown Chicago:
Take the Blue Line – you have three options to come to the house:
In general, the trip will take about 35-40 minutes.
1 – Get off on Logan Square – take the bus #76 – get off on Pulaski – walk North pass the Fire Station and the Self Storage warehouse – make a left on George street to find the house.
2 – Get off on Kinball/Belmont Station – take bus #77 – get off on Pulaski – take bus #53 to George Street – walk West (right) to the house
3- Get off on Irving Park - take the bus #53 going South Pulaski (right) to George St. - walk West (right) to the house.",False,False,False,False,,True,False,75.0,"[{'milestones': {'titles': ['<b>Jan 11, 3:00PM</b>', 'Check-in'], 'subtitles': [], 'type': 'check_in'}, 'localized_cancellation_policy_name': 'Strict', 'cancellation_policy_label': 'strict_14_with_grace_period', 'cancellation_policy_price_type': None, 'cancellation_policy_price_factor': 0.0, 'cancellation_policy_id': 44, 'book_it_module_tooltip': 'After that, cancel before 3:00PM on Jan 4 and get a 50% refund, minus the service fee.', 'subtitle': 'After that, cancel before 3:00PM on Jan 4 and get a 50% refund, minus the service fee.'}]",0.0,0.0,0,2020-01-11,2020-01-14,2019-12-28,2019-06-22 19:27:49+00:00,2015-10-13 17:31:43+00:00

The energy in the neighborhood changes on days and nights when there is a Cubs game. When the Cubs have a game everything bursts with energy as the neighborhood's souvenir shops, eateries and bars are often busy before, during, and after the games.

River will spend all day with you, if you want.
Hawaii 5-0 or NCIS at 9 pm weekday evenings

Older neighborhood of young families and retirees.  We have a park / school nearby for kids to enjoy.

Glen Ellyn is one of the safest neighborhoods in the area.  We are not near South Chicago and its crime challenges.  And we have three local policemen for neighbors.

You will need a car to visit local attractions and go to the metro/train station.

Uber has a real good local team here - many guests go to work each day on Uber.

If you need a early or late check-out time, please check with me. Weekends will not be a problem; weekdays we will try to work out...

We like quiet after 10 pm / before 6 am.

Note I have two other rooms listed on B&B.

If you are not comfortable with dogs, you might not appreciate River - she is a well-trained golden retriever, and loves to interact with all our guests.

We are a Christian family, I (Mike)  am a military veteran, and while my girls are traveling the world this summer, I decided to try Air B&B at our home. 

I am fine with late arrivals and early departures, as long as we don't wake up the other guests.","- Wood floors - no shoes please

Check-In Rules:
Unfortunately, I will not always be able to personally meet all guests at their desired check in time.

If I'm unable to meet you, I'll provide the Digital Door Lock Code with very detailed instructions for entry which will be messaged through Airbnb messenger at your Check-In time.

There is absolutely NO consumption of food or beverages (excluding water) outside of the kitchen, kitchen bar, and dining room.

All food and beverages in the fridge and kitchen cabinets belong to other guests and your host. Refrain from taking food/beverages that were not brought in or purchased by you. Coffee, creamer, and sugar on the coffee bar in the kitchen are complimentary and you may have as much of it as you'd like. 

Guest Policy:
""Guest"" constitutes any person entering the property, whether spending the night or only visiting. Unverified, unauthorized guests are not allowed on the premises. If you'd like to have a guest during your stay, your guest MUST be verified and announced through the AirBnb messenger and approval of this guest must be explicitly given by us, the hosts. Violation of this rule will result in immediate cancellation of your reservation and termination of your stay.

Quiet Hours:
Quiet Hours at the residence are between the hours of 10pm and 7am Sunday-Thursday and 12am and 7am on Friday-Saturday.

This is a Shared Space with many Travelers all visiting Chicago for a different purpose.  Having common courtesy is more than enough to fulfill this rule.  If you're a Late Night personality, please respect those waking up early for work.  If you're up at the crack of dawn, please get ready as quietly as possible as to not disturb those still asleep.

Smoking:

There will be no violence of any sort tolerated inside of the building.  This includes Physical Violence, Verbal (Arguing, Threats, Intimidation, etc.), and any sort of behavior that causes another person in the house to feel upset. 

‘Common Sense’ Rule:
As this is a Shared Building, guests are expected to act in a way which is both Respectful and Inviting to everyone else sharing the space.   Actions which are deemed to have a Negative Impact on the overall experience of the other travelers will not be tolerated.  A few examples of this would be:  Leaving Dishes unwashed in the sink, being excessively messy or loud, or just having a negative, unwelcoming attitude.  If Behavior is causing other Travelers to feel uncomfortable, we will ask you to make necessary corrections, if these corrections are not made, we will terminate your stay.

Illegal Activity:
Any action which is in violation of any law within the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois is grounds for instant Termination

The apartment building used to be a hotel in the 1900s, now converted to apartment units. The major perks of this unit is the surrounding area for shopping, restaurants, bars, proximity to the lake, and Diversey Harbor. I have board games and a piano if you are interested. There is a washer/dryer unit in the building.  I’m happy to answer any questions and give you recommendations on where to go.

Space is small, but charming and perfect. There is an AC unit which is highly effective.  The kitchen is COMICALLY small, but it has everything you could possibly need. I have clean towels, bedsheets, and shampoo/conditioner/body wash available for you.

You will have the space to yourselves.  There is a key box installed on location so check-in is quite flexible.

This neighborhood is buzzing with activity and very hip. Every shop you can think of. Starbucks and Stans Donuts is right around the corner. Chipotle even closer! The lake and Diversey Harbor is just a 10 minute walk away. You will also be close to the Red and Brown train lines if you are interested in taking public transportation.

You are in walking distance of a lot! I would also recommend the Divvy bikes (Chicago bike rental). The red and brown train lines are a 12 minute walk away.  There are several bus lines immediately in the proximity.  I would also recommend the ride share services Lyft and Uber.  Using google maps in particular, will point you in the right direction for public transit.

There is a pitcher in the refrigerator that provides filtered water that is regularly cleaned.  Please do not drink unfiltered Chicago tap water.  

If at all possible, please avoid the large closet in the bedroom area which contains personal items.  BUT...if you really have needs to hang clothing items please feel free.

The towel under the AC unit is there to absorb any condensation.  All is well there.

Just east of Downtown Chicago, the upscale suburb of Oak Brook is known for its rolling golf courses, high-end shopping, and concentration of corporate headquarters that draw visitors from around the world.

Within a short drive of the apartment, golfers can go for holes-in-one at Butterfield Country Club, Butler National Golf Club, Chicago Highlands Club, Fresh Meadow Golf Club, and more. These country clubs are also known for their banquet and social event facilities.

Golf courses aren’t the only places to relax around here; don’t miss the beautiful Morton Arboretum, known for hiking and biking trails and summertime picnic spots. The Danada Forest Preserve is home to lush parkland and the Danada House, a popular wedding venue. Craving a delicious meal? Don’t miss Oak Brook’s impressive dining scene, which features high-end steakhouses like Michael Jordan’s Restaurant and The Capital Grille.

When the Windy City weather takes a turn, head inside to the plethora of leisure attractions in the Oak Brook area. Shopaholics from around the Chicago metro head to the Oakbrook Center for stores like Restoration Hardware, Apple, and Louis Vuitton. It’s anchored by Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Macy’s, and Sears. In addition to the AMC Theatre at this mall, movie buffs can also catch the latest blockbusters at the AMC Dine-In at Yorktown Center, about 5 minutes from the apartment by car.

Oak Brook also means business; a plethora of national and global corporations have headquarters here. The head offices of Kellogg’s, RedBox, Ace Hardware, Microsoft, and more are within a few minutes’ drive.

Of course, no Chicago trip is complete without a selfie in front of the Bean or a slice of deep dish pizza. If you’re heading into Downtown Chi-Town, our apartment has easy freeway access, which makes accessing the city center a breeze.

While taking the L train is the best way to get around Downtown, we recommend driving to get to the highlights of Oak Brook. The apartment has free, secure parking - as does nearly every business, restaurant, and venue in Oak Brook.

If you’re flying into Chi-Town, we recommend renting a car and driving to the apartment. We’re a short drive from both O’Hare International Airport (about 20 minutes) and Midway (about 25 minutes).

Downtown Chicago is about a 30-minute drive from the apartment, depending on traffic. Keep in mind that traffic may increase during rush hour. If you’re heading into town for drinks, Uber and Lyft are available throughout the Chicago metro.

This apartment is in a building full of other units. Though none of the living spaces are shared, you may see your friendly neighbors coming and going.

And if you’re in town for a social event, you’ll be in close proximity to the numerous wedding venues, banquet halls, golf courses, country clubs, and restaurants of Oak Brook.

In the summer, take advantage of the sparkling outdoor pool and the picnic area, and in the winter, cozy up to the fireplace in the resident lounge or get some exercise in the fitness center.","You can’t find luxury and convenience like this in the city! This spacious 2BR/2BA is near Chicago’s biggest corporate headquarters, high-end shopping, and fantastic restaurants of the upscale Oak Brook suburb. This brand-new development boasts luxurious amenities like a gym and resort-style outdoor pool. The community also has 24/7 security and free parking. Get the best of urban living and residential comfort just a short drive from Downtown Chicago and O’Hare.","While taking the L train is the best way to get around Downtown, we recommend driving to get to the highlights of Oak Brook. The apartment has free, secure parking - as does nearly every business, restaurant, and venue in Oak Brook.

If you’re flying into Chi-Town, we recommend renting a car and driving to the apartment. We’re a short drive from both O’Hare International Airport (about 20 minutes) and Midway (about 25 minutes).

Downtown Chicago is about a 30-minute drive from the apartment, depending on traffic. Keep in mind that traffic may increase during rush hour. If you’re heading into town for drinks, Uber and Lyft are available throughout the Chicago metro.",True,True,False,False,,True,False,100.0,"[{'milestones': {'titles': ['<b>Jan 11, 3:00PM</b>', 'Check-in'], 'subtitles': [], 'type': 'check_in'}, 'localized_cancellation_policy_name': 'Strict', 'cancellation_policy_label': 'strict_14_with_grace_period', 'cancellation_policy_price_type': None, 'cancellation_policy_price_factor': 0.0, 'cancellation_policy_id': 44, 'book_it_module_tooltip': 'After that, cancel before 3:00PM on Jan 4 and get a 50% refund, minus the service fee.', 'subtitle': 'After that, cancel before 3:00PM on Jan 4 and get a 50% refund, minus the service fee.'}]",0.0,0.0,0,2020-01-11,2020-01-13,2019-12-28,2019-12-01 19:20:31+00:00,2019-07-18 20:14:58+00:00

With one of the best museums in the city, some fantastic contemporary art galleries and a booming bar and restaurant scene to boot with Michelin quality dining and the best Mexican Food in the city all within a few blocks. 

Pilsen has everything a fun and culture-loving Chicagoan could desire. Pilsen is one of the most recognizable neighborhoods in the city. With a distinct mural or piece of public art adorning a facade in nearly every block, it's not hard to see the artistic culture that's present. Lots of local breweries. Great Mexican bakeries with delicious super cheap eats. Lots of parks close by with many outdoor concerts and festivals throughout the year. There is also a film studio a few blocks away if you feel like trying out for a part. They film Chicago Fire there. And if you feel like buying a beautiful unique motorcycle or planting the seed to buy one in the future I highly recommend you check out  Motoworks a fantastic shop 1 block away.

For supply runs nearby is a Costco, Target, Walmart, movie theaters, outdoor shopping mall. At the end of the block is a great cheap famous 24 hour dinner that'll whip up almost anything you want.

Hospitals are around the corner  including UIC, Rush, Cook County. 15 minute uber ride to Soldier Field, United Center, McCormick convention center, Field Museum, Shed Aquarium, Art Institute,  Navy Peer, China Town and most other Chicago neighborhoods.
The Pink line L train is a quick 2 block walk from the apartment as an alternative....and its a great way to see the City too!

My place.....I mean YOUR NEW APARTMENT is 1 block from the Metra trains, and 2 blocks from the Pink line L train, bike rentals are also next to the pink line. 
I find it incredibly easy and affordable to get around via Uber/Lyft.

seven-foot windows that actually have an amazing view of downtown, particularly the John Hancock Building.

The place is comfortable, tidy, and efficiently located on Ashland Avenue in the heart of ultra-hip Wicker Park; Steps away from a thriving area full of popular restaurants, cafes, boutiques, concert venues, nightlife, etc.. There are convenient public transportation and Uber options from here also.

It is an expansive, high ceiling, three bedroom apartment. Everything you need for a comfortable stay is provided - full size beds, pillows, blankets, towels, toiletries, hair dryer, kitchen, and tv & wifi are all accessible to enhance your stay.

The entire apartment is available for your stay.

I, or my co-host, Nat, am/is available throughout your stay to answer questions that you may have; or recommend local attractions, dining, or nightlife.

Wicker Park is famous for live music and nightlife, chef-driven restaurants and countless art galleries — many housed within the Flat Iron Arts Building. If you have an acute knowledge of craft cocktails or an affinity for coffee, plus want to sift through records or thrifted threads, there's no better area to sip and shop in the country.

The area has become a prevailing influence on Chicago's Michelin-rated, James Beard Award-winning dining scene, boasting some of the city's most sought after tables. Wicker Park and Bucktown are also known for their palate pleasing nightcaps, like renowned brewery Piece and mixology tour de force The Violet Hour.

Along North, Division, Milwaukee and Damen Avenues, you will find an unbelievable blend of vintage shops amid independently-owned boutiques touting fashions for both men and women, and luxury home goods and beauty products. On the same blocks are nationally-recognized names in fashion, and a mix of major retail chains that have also set up shop to satisfy the on-trend crowds.”

The apartment is located just 0.4 mile from the Blue Line Damen Station (connecting to O’Hare airport) which travels through much of the city. The “9” Ashland Street Bus Stop is one block away - running north and south. Additionally, six blocks away is the Kennedy Expressway Division Street Exit. It is only three miles to downtown Chicago (10 minute Uber ride).

If you are looking for a family-friendly, fun, walkable place to stay during your trip to Chicago, The Harper House has it all!

Our space is cozy, modern, and brand new (gut renovated in 2019). Our location can't be beat, as you can walk to everything Hyde Park has to offer. The rest of Chicago is only a quick METRA (train) or ride share away!

Guests have access to the entire apartment.

I will be available during normal business hours during the day, and available for emergencies only after 5pm each day.

Hyde Park is an eclectic, historic neighborhood with a strong community feel. The University of Chicago campus is a short walk from the apartment. The neighborhood is very walkable! 

From Time Out magazine: ""Back in 1893, Hyde Park played host to the World's Columbian Exposition. Today, it's home to one of the most prestigious colleges in the country, one of the best museums and a happening restaurant scene. The neighborhood's gorgeous architecture makes its rich history quite salient. Hyde Park is accessible by way of bus, Green Line, Metra or a quick cruise down Lake Shore Drive. Head to the beautiful South Side 'hood and enjoy all of the culture and entertainment that it has to offer.""

Whole Foods and Trader Joe's are both very close walks from the apartment! Most of the restaurants in Hyde Park are casual and approachable. If you would like to venture outside of Hyde Park for nightlife and diverse dining options, the areas of Pilsen, West Loop, Downtown (the Loop), and River North are short rideshare-rides away.

We have cameras ON in common areas and locks in rooms

You will have a comfortable Full Size Bed in a private room! We want you feel very safe so your room is going to have its own lock and key and there are cameras in common areas. 

This is a private room in a shared place with other Airbnb guests and because of that we expect to keep the house  very quiet, specially after 9pm.

There is few free parking on the street, plenty paid parking around the house.

If you text Alejandra she will be there for you most of the time she is going to give you quick responses! If you are a tourist she will love to share some places you can’t miss!

This place is very close to Downtown Chicago, and it’s a great picturesque neighborhood with a lot of murals (for what is known), great restaurants, good night life. We have one block away my favorite Margarita’s place in Chicago! 

There are few free street parking around the neighborhood. 18 bus is just 1/2 block away. 18th Pink line is 15min walk. 60 bus is 8min walk. McCormick Place is 9min far by car/25min by public transportation. United Center is 10min far by car/30min by public transportation. Rush is 9min by car/21min by public transportation. Grant Park is 9min by car/28min by public transportation. The Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium and the Planetarium is 11 min far by car/27 min by public transportation. Uber are very cheap 5-10$ to those places specially if you choose the pool option!

This is a safe and night life neighborhood so you can walk around it but without forget it that you are in Chicago so don’t leave belongings at sight in your car. Parking is such a tough situation in Chicago although there are few streets where you can Free park around the house (Racine street, May street  but one street behind the airbnb building not in front of airbnb building, Cullerton street, 19th street, Carpenter Street, 18th south side ). Parking is usually easy before 5pm, after 5pm is hard to find a free spot but not imposible. Just make sure 1) you read all signs posted in the street/ trees or fences that says information about street cleaning , reparation, disabilities parking, permit parking, school days, etc 2) you are not over the crosswalk, near a hydrant, or wrong way.

The room is private but you will share common areas ( kitchen , living room, and the bathroom/s) with other Airbnb guests. Usually none of this get crowd because most of Airbnb guests are most of the time outside the house knowing the city, in concerts, interviews, etc, and they don’t spend much time in the house. A private apartment in the area usually cost over 120$ p/night plus taxes and fees which is in total almost 200$ p/night ! If you want save some money and being close to downtown, surrounding great public transportation and with free street parking this could be a great option for you! 

The room has one full size bed. If you want to add 3rd or 4th guest in the reservation I could add 1 extra air mattress with no extra fee if the reservation is set for 3 or 4. If the reservation is for 2 and you’d like to have an extra air mattress we charge $15p/night and we provide air mattress and linens for it. the room will become smaller for luggage becase you will have two beds on it. This is a good option if you want to save even more money otherwise you can book two rooms! 
As most houses in United States this is not made with concrete so you will hear people walking or outside sounds. It doesn’t bother most of the guest but if you are a very light sleeper maybe you should choose an entire place. or have an earphone or something to block the sound.

We have cameras ON in common areas, one is located outside the apartment in the entrance the other one is in the living room.

Is forbidden in this place: parties, small gatherings, to bring people who are not in the reservation, family reunions, birthdays celebration, video shooting,  being noisy, smoke and bring pets. 

We work based in all airbnb policies, terms and conditions including cancelation policy, so makes sure before you book to read carefully houses rules or cancelation policy.","1.

Let me know if you need anything! I'd love to suggest restaurants or where to have a great time in Chicago.

The West Loop is the hottest and SAFEST areas in Chicago bar none.  You'll be within walking distance of the restaurant's everyone is talking about like ""Girl and the Goat"" and ""Soho House"" and close enough to nightlife without ever hearing it.

The front patio is available for guest use.,"You'll feel right at home in our fully private studio in Bridgeport, a quiet Chicago neighborhood with a rich history. Just 5 miles from downtown! Easily accessible from Midway and O'Hare, 1 mile from White Sox stadium (Guaranteed Rate Field), 15 minutes from the heart of the Loop, and convenient to McCormick Place, IIT, UIC, and Chinatown. You can easily walk to great coffee, diverse restaurants, art galleries, and more, while getting a taste of an authentic working-class Chicago neighborhood.

Our garden-level studio features a private entrance, private bathroom, lots of natural light, a full-size murphy wall bed with Tuft & Needle mattress, futon (which converts to a second full-size bed), desk and task chair, fridge, microwave, coffee/tea. Unwind with fast WiFi, a smart TV, board games, and more.

Guests use a street-facing private entrance. The front patio is available for guest use.

We live upstairs. The guest studio is totally private, and we will give you space. But if you need anything, don't hesitate to ask!

Bridgeport is a historic working-class neighborhood which is experiencing a rapid transformation into an arts and cultural hub. Originally settled by European immigrants, many of whom built the Illinois and Michigan Canal, the neighborhood is now among the most ethnically and culturally diverse in Chicago. You will find an eclectic mix of boutique coffee shops, diners, classic dive bars, hipster breweries, and art studios.

Free street parking (plentiful during the day, more sparse after the end of the workday). One block from the #8 Halsted bus, just a few bus stops from the Halsted Orange Line stop (and the #62 and #44 buses), and 3 blocks from the #35 35th Street bus. Easily accessible from Midway (Orange Line / #8 bus) or O'Hare (Blue Line / Orange Line / #8 bus).

**Note on Seasonal Temperature**
The guest space is the bottom floor of the building, and as such it is the most difficult part of the house to heat. During the cold months of the year, we do not recommend this space for guests who need extra-warm temperatures in order to feel comfortable.

Free street parking! On crowded days you may have to park a block or two away.

Our space is one room + one bathroom. Both the bed and the sofa bed/futon are in the same room - there are no private bedrooms. Accordingly, the space is best suited to a solo traveler or couple, or friends who don't mind sleeping in the same room. Children are welcome to stay with parents - if a floor-level bed is preferable for safety, we can provide a twin-size air mattress.  (Parents, please note that there is no bathtub, only a stall shower).

You’ll be staying on the bottom level of our family home. We have small children. Sound isolation is decent, but you will hear our footsteps, furniture, and indistinct voices, generally between 7:00am and 8:00pm.
Our laundry room is adjacent to the guest studio. You may hear us doing laundry during the day.
There is a small business located in the building, and you may hear clients coming and going during weekday afternoons.
You may also hear the faint sounds of a piano through the air vent in the afternoon.
If you are looking for a totally quiet stay, our space may not be a good fit.

Quiet hours: 10:00pm - 8:00am.

Absolutely no drugs, smoking, or vaping.

Please do not burn incense or scented candles in the suite.

Feel free to have a few friends over! Please, no parties.

The entrance to the unit has a low doorway - you may need to duck!

There are two short flights of stairs on the way into the unit.","Quiet hours are 10:00pm to 8:00am. Soft music, TV, and conversation are just fine.","We live upstairs.

Be sure to check out some of the city's other popular attractions like Navy Pier, McCormick Place, and of course Guaranteed Rate Field, home of the Chicago White Sox, during your Illinois getaway.

Chicago's diverse population helps bolster the city's booming culinary scene. If you're looking for some authentic international fare eat your way through Chinatown, Little Italy, and Greektown, all of which sit within 15 minutes of the property. Grab a Chicago-style hot dog at Portillo’s or some delicious deep dish pizza at Gino’s East.

Welcome to contact me regarding any concerns.

You get a private bedroom with a closet, hangers, iron and a full size bed ideal for two but has worked for three small persons. I also have a twin mattress available for a third person. 

There is central heating and air conditioning throughout the apartment to keep you comfortable throughout all the temperature shifts that Chicago can throw at you. You will also get access to the guest Wi-Fi network upon your arrival. 

The kitchen has a stove and a small assortment of pots, pans and cooking utensils for you cook your meals in  and a refrigerator you are welcome to use as well.  


The apartment features a clean open layout with a combined dining room and living room.

Around the apartment you'll see works from some of my favorite artists as well as some of my photographs from my travels.

Guests will be able to make use of the kitchen, bathroom and dining space in addition to the bedroom.

I'll be available to answer any questions you may have about the city while you're around. 
If you need a quiet space to come to after a long day of work, touring around the city, or raging at a festival,  you'll have no problem here. 
I've also had the pleasure of sharing meals, drinks and dances with some of guests, I'll have no problem helping you get the most out of your time in Chicago.

Just two blocks from Wentworth (one of the main strips in Chinatown) you'll have easy access to plenty of delicious dinning options. Duck, Dim Sum, Hot Pot/Steamboat,  Noodles, Bakeries, Tea cafes, Dessert cafes, Korean and Vietnamese are some of the many options. There is also a taco stand and the best sandwich in the world (according to USA Today 2015) right across the highway. 

There are a couple of museums in the neighborhood one dedicated to the History of Chinatown and the other to Asian art. Various gift shops can be found as well as small Chinese grocery stores. There is western pharmacy down the street as well if you need to get western snack or easy foods as well. 

The are some lovely parks to walk around, one to note is Ping Tom park where you can get a great view of the skyline and during the summer months also has a water taxi to downtown. If you're lucky you might also catch a movie or live band.

The Red Line train is the easiest way to get around the city, but there are plenty of buses to take you to McCormick Place, the Loop, Bridgeport or Pilsen. 

The apartment is also close to several highways and there is free neighborhood parking in the streets a half block away.

The Cermak/Chinatown MRT/ Rail station is a 10 minute walk which will take you to the loop in less than 5 minutes.

The neighborhood is also in between McCormick Place convention center and the trendy Pilsen and Bridgeport neighborhoods. Uber can get you to either destination in about 5 minutes. You can walk to McCormick Place in about half an hour.

You are renting the guestroom in my apartment.

The bedroom is ideal for two persons but it is available for three if you are looking for a budget friendly accommodation. I've had several very positive experiences with this option so I keep offering it.

I prefer to greet my guests in person but if I'm at work or head to bed early I leave key for my guests in a key safe outside the building.","• Check-in time is after 4:30pm.

Since we will be sharing space, I will be home at all times when guests are in my house. I do not give out a house key. We need to coordinate when you would expect to be at the house, so that I can make sure to be there for you. I am gone during the midday at work. Most guests are out of the house by around 10 or 11 am and return in the evening after 8pm. I am happy to hang out with you when possible to share ideas for your visit, but I'm also fine to leave you be if you prefer. Open communication about your schedule, before and during your visit, would be greatly appreciated.

The house is in the Belmont Cragin neighborhood of Chicago. It is a very residential street with lots of families and caring neighbors. I enjoy interacting with my neighbors so we can improve our community. It is a quiet street away from the hustle and bustle of the central part of the city, but close enough to get to all the fun city sites by car or public transit.

The house is two blocks away from the main bus lines of Cicero, Fullerton, Grand and Armitage. The house is a short walk from the Metra line, and one bus ride away from the blue, red or brown CTA lines. It takes about 30 minutes to get downtown by car and about 45 minutes by bus. Uber and Lyft are very popular and easy to utilize in Chicago.","I get up each day around 7 and work from home in the mornings. I get home from work on most nights around 7pm and go to bed around 11.  I would appreciate it if guests were in and quiet by midnight. There is no smoking in the house, but you are welcome to smoke on the back deck as long as you use an ashtray. You are free to store food in the fridge and warm things up in the microwave. There are disposable plates, cups, napkins and silverware in your room for your use. Please dispose of all food related trash in the trashcan by the kitchen to keep bugs out of your room.

NO SHOES in the apartment (its a Japanese thing). We have provided slippers for you. It keeps the place cleaner. If you have a pet we can consider it based on a case to case basis but please contact me first. 

Please no one under 21 yrs old without a parent or guardian. Thank you.

Please clean any dishes you use. If you leave a few glasses it's no biggie however if you leave a sink full of dishes there will be an additional $25 fee. My cleaning lady is on a strict schedule and charges extra for the time it takes her. So PLEASE don't leave a sink full of dishes! Thanks!

Please be HONEST about how many guests are staying. There is a SURCHARGE for deception...JUST BE HONEST. The building has cameras! Additional guests  without prior notification will be charged DOUBLE the nightly guest rate. 

ABSOLUTELY NO parties! You will immediately forfeit you stay without a refund. *IF YOU ARE TRYING TO BE SLICK AND BOOK TO THROW A PARTY AND/OR THEN TRY TO CANCEL: I WILL KEEP WHATEVER MONEY YOU PAY PER THE CANCELLATION POLICY. 

I want to preface the following by saying 95% of our guests leave our places in amazing condition. We are very understanding about small messes that may have been overlooked as I know I am by no means perfect. That being said the following is to address the 5% who may not understand quite how airbnb works yet. 
1. We are not a hotel. 
2. We are not your personal maids. 

While there is a cleaning fee, the fee is to cover changing of linens, washing of towels and ""normal"" cleaning of the kitchen, bathroom and living areas. What is not covered and WILL incur an extra fee are the following: 

1. A pile of dishes left in the sink (violates house rules)
2. Excessive kitchen messes such as cooking grease all over the stove.
3. Excessive food on the floors (I dont mean a few crumbs-I mean it looked like someone was feeding pigeons).
4. Chewing gum ground into the furniture (yes, that has actually happened).
5. OBVIOUS wearing of shoes in the unit (we are a no-shoes house- see house rules) ie shoes foot prints, tracked in dirt and mud.
5. Anything else above and beyond what is considered ""normal"" cleaning. 
6. smoking in the unit will AUTOMATICALLY  incur a $200 fee. 

Again- this ISNT the majority of our guests and we understand things can be overlooked. Upon an ""excessive cleaning"" situation, I will not leave any review, I will simply send a request for an extra cleaning fee (usually around $25-50) depending on how much extra time it took to clean.

"1) The entire property is smoke and vapor free. We have marijuana and tobacco chemical sensors on the property. They know it's not cooking smoke, They react to airborne particulate, not the smell on your clothes. The PolySens® technology works, so exit the building if you want to smoke/vape or you'll be fined $500 and asked to leave.

2) Your reservation has paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number, whether visiting or sleeping, you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first.

3) Quiet hours are 10PM-8AM. Noise should not be heard coming from your apartment. This is a quiet residential building. 95% of our guests have no issues, and never hear from us. We will be sure to send you at least 2 warnings prior to asking anyone to leave, but one way or another, the apartment must be quiet.

4) Parties, events, and commercial activity are not allowed.

5) We reserve the right to ask you to leave without a refund if any of the above rules are broken.

6) Lost keys will incur a $100 charge. We have to change the locks. Please use the app to send a picture of all the keys at check-in AND check-out.

7) We do not accept instant bookings from residents of the Chicago metropolitan area as identified by profile city or phone number area code. If you live near Chicago and would like to book a stay, please send us a message with a little more information about your plans

8) Our favorite restaurant in Chicago is La Scarola.

Privacy Statement on the Use of Security Cameras:
We respect and value the privacy of our guests. We will never place a camera inside a living space. While Airbnb policy allows cameras in spaces that are not used for sleeping or bathing, we disagree. Cameras should be banned from inside all living spaces. Footage should be automatically deleted. Everything should be disclosed in advance. We use hallway security cameras to verify the number of guests who have entered an apartment. This is useful for stopping parties, and under additional prices extra guest charges may apply for extra people sleeping over.  All footage is deleted automatically after a stay, unless there is an open resolution center case. It’s unfortunate that not every guest is honest about their intentions, and our community would not allow us to be on Airbnb if we did not prevent unwanted behaviors. Let us know if you have questions.

PARKING
There's a parking lot around the corner which you can book in advance on an app.  It doesn't get much easier than that in Chicago.  Street parking is hard to find and not recommended.
----------
CHECK-IN TIME 
Typically, guests may receive the keys and drop their bags in the apartment as early as 12PM (noon). The cleaners do need until 4PM to do their work, and the apartment may be dirty anytime until 4.  
If you'd like to drop your bags early and head out until the cleaners finish, we can usually accommodate you!

CHECK-OUT TIME
11AM is check-out. If you'll need a check-out after 11AM, and the night after your stay isn't booked yet, let's chat about booking that next night! Then you could leave as late as you'd like that day!

Need luggage storage the morning of check-in or the afternoon of check-out?
We have a locker in a storage unit a ten-minute walk away! (It's .2 miles, just across a couple of stoplights!) Details provided the day before arrival.
----------
OCCUPANCY 
Upon booking, your reservation will have paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number whether visiting or sleeping,  you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first. 
We consider the maximum capacity of the apartment to be its sleeping capacity - FOUR individuals. Anyone past four would not be permitted. 
Enjoy the city! Please don’t bring a party back.
----------

The nightly rate changes based on number of guests, which is verified upon arrival. Please do your best to let me know how many guests will be staying in advance!

Unit may be accessed by maintenance for repairs during stays.

We do not accept instant bookings from residents of the Chicago metropolitan area as identified by profile city or phone number area code. If you live near Chicago and would like to book a stay, please send us a message with a little more information about your plans

Immediately after booking, we will send you a few questions about your arrival time, contact info, number of guests/visitors, and to name our favorite restaurant, which is listed at the bottom of the house rules. Guests will not be allowed to check in without providing complete answers","1) The entire property is smoke and vapor free. We have marijuana and tobacco chemical sensors on the property. They know it's not cooking smoke, They react to airborne particulate, not the smell on your clothes. The PolySens® technology works, so exit the building if you want to smoke/vape or you'll be fined $500 and asked to leave.

2) Your reservation has paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number, whether visiting or sleeping, you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first.

3) Quiet hours are 10PM-8AM. Noise should not be heard coming from your apartment. This is a quiet residential building. 95% of our guests have no issues, and never hear from us. We will be sure to send you at least 2 warnings prior to asking anyone to leave, but one way or another, the apartment must be quiet.

4) Parties, events, and commercial activity are not allowed.

5) We reserve the right to ask you to leave without a refund if any of the above rules are broken.

6) Lost keys will incur a $100 charge. We have to change the locks. Please use the app to send a picture of all the keys at check-in AND check-out.

Privacy Statement on the Use of Security Cameras:
We respect and value the privacy of our guests. We will never place a camera inside a living space. While Airbnb policy allows cameras in spaces that are not used for sleeping or bathing, we disagree. Cameras should be banned from inside all living spaces. Footage should be automatically deleted. Everything should be disclosed in advance. We use hallway security cameras to verify the number of guests who have entered an apartment. This is useful for stopping parties, and under additional prices extra guest charges may apply for extra people sleeping over.  All footage is deleted automatically after a stay, unless there is an open resolution center case. It’s unfortunate that not every guest is honest about their intentions, and our community would not allow us to be on Airbnb if we did not prevent unwanted behaviors. Let us know if you have questions. We have nothing to hide.","We love our guests! We are available to our guests! 
We text our guests most of what they need! 
...WE NEED A NUMBER TO REACH YOU AT! 
Please confirm your phone number and email address upon booking.

IF YOU WILL NOT HAVE A US PHONE NUMBER, we ask that you download the Whats App phone texting app. We also have We Chat - please provide your ID!","WICKER PARK!

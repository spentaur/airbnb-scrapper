"1) The entire property is smoke and vapor free. We have marijuana and tobacco chemical sensors on the property. They know it's not cooking smoke, They react to airborne particulate, not the smell on your clothes. The PolySens® technology works, so exit the building if you want to smoke/vape or you'll be fined $500 and asked to leave.

2) Your reservation has paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number, whether visiting or sleeping, you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first.

3) Quiet hours are 10PM-8AM. Noise should not be heard coming from your apartment. This is a quiet residential building. 95% of our guests have no issues, and never hear from us. We will be sure to send you at least 2 warnings prior to asking anyone to leave, but one way or another, the apartment must be quiet.

4) Parties, events, and commercial activity are not allowed.

5) We reserve the right to ask you to leave without a refund if any of the above rules are broken.

6) Lost keys will incur a $100 charge. We have to change the locks. Please use the app to send a picture of all the keys at check-in AND check-out.

7) We do not accept instant bookings from residents of the Chicago metropolitan area as identified by profile city or phone number area code. If you live near Chicago and would like to book a stay, please send us a message with a little more information about your plans

8) Our favorite restaurant in Chicago is La Scarola.

Privacy Statement on the Use of Security Cameras:
We respect and value the privacy of our guests. We will never place a camera inside a living space. While Airbnb policy allows cameras in spaces that are not used for sleeping or bathing, we disagree. Cameras should be banned from inside all living spaces. Footage should be automatically deleted. Everything should be disclosed in advance. We use hallway security cameras to verify the number of guests who have entered an apartment. This is useful for stopping parties, and under additional prices extra guest charges may apply for extra people sleeping over.  All footage is deleted automatically after a stay, unless there is an open resolution center case. It’s unfortunate that not every guest is honest about their intentions, and our community would not allow us to be on Airbnb if we did not prevent unwanted behaviors. Let us know if you have questions.

We do not accept instant bookings from residents of the Chicago metropolitan area as identified by profile city or phone number area code. If you live near Chicago and would like to book a stay, please send us a message with a little more information about your plans

Immediately after booking, we will send you a few questions about your arrival time, contact info, number of guests/visitors, and to name our favorite restaurant, which is listed at the bottom of the house rules. Guests will not be allowed to check in without providing complete answers","1) The entire property is smoke and vapor free. We have marijuana and tobacco chemical sensors on the property. They know it's not cooking smoke, They react to airborne particulate, not the smell on your clothes. The PolySens® technology works, so exit the building if you want to smoke/vape or you'll be fined $500 and asked to leave.

2) Your reservation has paid for a specific number of guests on it. Anyone over this number, whether visiting or sleeping, you must have written permission from us. We have a hallway camera to verify. We're going to be totally fine with 95% of requests, but we do require you to clear it with us first.

3) Quiet hours are 10PM-8AM. Noise should not be heard coming from your apartment. This is a quiet residential building. 95% of our guests have no issues, and never hear from us. We will be sure to send you at least 2 warnings prior to asking anyone to leave, but one way or another, the apartment must be quiet.

4) Parties, events, and commercial activity are not allowed.

5) We reserve the right to ask you to leave without a refund if any of the above rules are broken.

6) Lost keys will incur a $100 charge. We have to change the locks. Please use the app to send a picture of all the keys at check-in AND check-out.

Privacy Statement on the Use of Security Cameras:
We respect and value the privacy of our guests. We will never place a camera inside a living space. While Airbnb policy allows cameras in spaces that are not used for sleeping or bathing, we disagree. Cameras should be banned from inside all living spaces. Footage should be automatically deleted. Everything should be disclosed in advance. We use hallway security cameras to verify the number of guests who have entered an apartment. This is useful for stopping parties, and under additional prices extra guest charges may apply for extra people sleeping over.  All footage is deleted automatically after a stay, unless there is an open resolution center case. It’s unfortunate that not every guest is honest about their intentions, and our community would not allow us to be on Airbnb if we did not prevent unwanted behaviors. Let us know if you have questions. We have nothing to hide.","We love our guests! We are available to our guests! 
We text our guests most of what they need! 
...WE NEED A NUMBER TO REACH YOU AT! 
Please confirm your phone number and email address upon booking.

IF YOU WILL NOT HAVE A US PHONE NUMBER, we ask that you download the Whats App phone texting app. We also have We Chat - please provide your ID!","WICKER PARK!

in Chicago's Logan Square? Stay steps away from culinary greatness in this warm and sun-drenched apartment.

This spacious one-bedroom apartment includes a relatively new Casper queen-sized mattress. The large living room includes a comfortable couch for an additional sleeper, as well as a daybed. 

A block from the California Blue Line stop, you'll be able to shuffle downtown in mere minutes.  The booming Logan Square restaurant and bar scene is a short walk from the front door.  Or, lounge in the sun-filled living room, use the desk and wi-fi to catch up on work, or sip some lemonade on the cute back deck.  

Street parking is almost never a problem, though it is getting trickier in the evening. Also! Portions of the street ARE permit only--keep an eye out. If you'd like to increase your parking options by using daily permits, please let me know. If so, please familiarize yourself with permit use: https://www.chicityclerk.com/city-stickers-parking/about-parking-permits

This classic Chicago apartment will enhance your Chicago experience, as will the paintings and prints by local artists that line the walls.  

The building is charming and well kept, but it is over 100 yrs old. Sometimes the water lightens for a second (though it's never cold), and sometimes, you must open the windows, because the radiators have worked too well (not a bad problem to have).  The living room and the bedroom each have AC window units, though the kitchen can get warm in the summer. The apartment also gets a great breeze, because the backdoor opens onto the top (3rd) floor balcony.  It's true--they don't build them like they used to: you will rarely hear the neighbors. However! Please remove shoes and be careful when dropping bags. The floor does amplify sound to the person below.

The pets will need to stay home (allergies), but children could be discussed. Also, small groups could be discussed. The apartment could--and has--worked well for a friends weekend, etc. There's no smoking in the apartment, but you could smoke on the back deck.

There are many shelves of books that you are welcome to dive into during your stay. If you wanted the opportunity to discover new Chicago writers or catch up on some contemporary fiction, it will be available to you.

The apartment has a full kitchen with everything you need to make meals. A coffee maker and grinder are also provided.  There is a kettle for tea.  

Just a couple blocks from the apartment is Palmer Square Park, and it's a great place to jog or walk --there's a path that circles it.  There's also a small playground, if you do have a child.

This is a third floor apartment—the very top floor. You'll find a little bouquet on the door. 

*Only those with full profiles will be considered.*

You'll have the full apartment!

I'll be available for any questions you might have. Texting is the best way to reach me.

We do ask that you respect our neighbors by keeping noise to a reasonable level.,"Welcome to Chicago! Home of the World Series Champs, the Cubs. Our large 1-bedroom/1-bath condo is just 1 mile from Wrigley Field and is ideal for any Chicago getaway. It features a full kitchen, a private bedroom, and conveniences like a full kitchen and fast WiFi. 

Metered parking is available nearby, but it gets more difficult to park at night. I recommend taking the train for your entire stay. The closest train station is Paulina-Lincoln/Roscoe Station, just a 3-min walk away.

Illuminated by sunny natural light, our studio features Queen-size bed, premium linens, and plenty of closet space so you can unpack and forget about your suitcase for a while. Enjoy the privacy of your own room, with doors that close and independently controlled air-conditioning units.

The apartment includes one full bathroom, with a shower, sink, and toilet. We’re all about helping you look (and smell) your best, so we provide shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in addition to hand soap and fluffy towels. Trust us when we say there’s no better way to warm up after a Windy City walk than a hot shower!

There’s ample space for guests to relax on the sofa and watch on a large flat-screen TV. Like the rest of the unit, you’ll live it up in luxury among hardwood floors and contemporary decor. The entire place has free, fast WiFi and Chicago sunshine streaming in through the windows.

Whether you’re craving a home-cooked meal or just somewhere to put the box of deep-dish, our kitchen is fully stocked with cookware, dishes, utensils, and has swanky granite countertops. Appliances include a full-sized fridge and freezer, gas stove, oven, microwave, toaster, and coffee maker. The only things missing are your favorite farmer’s market finds!!

Please make yourself at home in this gorgeous apartment; our place is yours and only yours during your stay. We do ask that you respect our neighbors by keeping noise to a reasonable level.

Just west of Chicago’s hip Lake View neighborhood and steps from the Paulina-Lincoln/Roscoe L Station, our residential location is the perfect place to relax and recharge on any trip to vibrant Chicago.

Here you’ll find cozy restaurants, low-key bars, eclectic boutiques, and all the essentials for a comfortable stay. There’s a Target just 5 minutes away on foot (home of things you never knew you needed), several banks, a Whole Foods Market, and a variety of exercise options including a YMCA, Pure Barre, and Core Power Yoga all within a couple of blocks.

If you’re coming to town for a Cubs game, there’s no need pack into the train like sardines with hundreds of other Cubs fans - we’re just 1 mile from Wrigley Field, and walking is a nice way to stretch your legs before or after a game.

But that’s not the only attraction (besides Target) that’s accessible on foot from our place; you’ll find a plethora of fantastic places to eat and drink just minutes away. Don’t miss the exquisite pastries from Loba Pastry + Coffee or the German delicacies from Dinkel's Bakery - both excellent ways to start the day.

In the mood for tacos? Head to Cafe El Tapatio for authentic Mexican eats. Or dig into some spicy curry or noodles at Thai Thank You (pro tip: it’s BYOB). And pizza never disappoints, especially when it’s from Pizzeria Serio. Wash it all down with a cold treat from Scooter's Frozen Custard or Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams, and you’ve got a memorable eating experience.


When you’re searching for souvenirs or some retail therapy, walk over to Southport Avenue, where you’ll find shops selling everything from cosmetics to beer to sneakers. Only brought a carry on? Maybe skip the shops and head to Southport Lanes & Billiards, where you can play old-school billiards and try your hand at bowling. Or, if you’re up for a walk, take the Brown line to Belmont Station and walk 15 minutes to the Lakefront Trail for stunning views of Lake Michigan.

Why splurge on an expensive rental car when you can take advantage of Chicago’s great public transportation system? Our place is just a 3-minute walk from Paulina-Lincoln/Roscoe Station, where you can catch the Brown Line train. The Brown Line will take you south to Downtown Chicago in just about 15 minutes, or you can head north to Uptown or Evanston when you transfer to the Red Line at Belmont Station.

Flying into Chicago? We’re a 20-minute drive from O’Hare when there is no traffic, but if there is traffic you may be better off taking public transit (and saving some $$ on the taxi or Uber fare). Take the Blue Line from O’Hare to Belmont & Kimball, then transfer to the #77 bus and ride for about 15 minutes to Belmont & Paulina.

In addition to public transit, ridesharing (Uber or Lyft) is also a great way to get around the Chicago metro. When you’re heading out with a group or want that extra little bit of luxury, just request a ride - they’re readily available and can take you anywhere you want to go.

What you get?  Hotel quality beds, TV, full kitchen, full patio and grill, 7 beds, Full House to yourself, Ez ""Self Checking"", Centered location, personal recommendations, and an easy to use guidebook an instructions once you book. We have all the towels, kitchen utensils needed for a long term stay. We even have some baby friendly amenities if requested. We also added a SNES classic with 30 games, and by March we will have the place full of Chicago Trivia and Facts, and more themed rooms!

Layout: We have 7 Beds in this unit. One room has a top of the line GreenTea Memory foam King mattress, with a nart deco theme. Another room has two queen size beds and a comfy memory foam pullout as well. Living room has couch plus 2 memory foam pullouts via the daybed in the living room. And an extra pullout if needed. :) 

Location: We are located in West Lakeview, which is a centered location, and pretty much 10 minutes away from anything  you want in the city. We are 5 minutes from Wrigley. 10 second walk from the best Cuban in town. And we have all the food shopping you could want in walking distance. Perfect for families and long stays. :) Also this location is VERY safe. A lot of schools, people walking dogs, and a very charming neighborhood vibe if that is important to you.

Parking: Don't be fooled, Chicago is AMAZING, no doubt about that. But because of that parking can be a nightmare, with up to $60 a day parking. Luckily we have one of the best blocks in the city, because our block is FREE to park on. So you even with 2-3 cars, they can all park safely and easily. :) 

This place goes fast! We won't be beat, found a comparable place with a good location and amount of beds? Maybe I can try and price match for you. Want to stay over 7 days, shoot me a message, I'll see what I can do. :D

The Pictures should do most the talking, but again.

Again, very safe, very family friendly. And plenty to walk to. It's Lakeview, pretty much centered. :)

I recommend Uber/lyft to all my guests. reason being, the train/bus cost $2.50-$3.00 per person. Which is pretty much the same you'd pay with Lyft. And on top of that, you'll save precious hours, which is the most important thing on this trip, because who know's when you'll be back to this amazing city.

Due note like all apartments, you'll probably hear some slight noise above during day hours. 

The no Party rule, helps me keep booking amazing 5 star guests and families, and helps the other 5 star guests and families feel safe that others in the neighboring units are highly qualified guests. :)

Clean towels, sheets and shampoo/conditioner. Washer and dryer. HBO go, Roku box, Netflix and a variety of movies and books. 

Extra charges for the following:

Flat fee of $25 for pets (no more than 2 please)

Flat fee of $25 if you would like to check in before 3pm… If you want to come in like 30 mins earlier and if I am able to accommodate you, I will (no charge)

Flat fee of $25 If you want to stay later. I ask people “check out"" by 11am, if you plan on staying later you are welcome to stay till 3pm for the extra fee, but this needs to be arranged before hand. Please do not ask to stay later the morning of check out, its just not cool.

Flat fee of $10 if you would like leave bags after you have “checked out"" of my place. So if you have a later flight and want to continue exploring city without the hassle of pulling your suitcase around, you are welcome to. But this needs to be arranged before hand. 

I am more than willing to accommodate you, so long as you communicate what is needed prior to arrival.

I make an effort to meet as many of my guests as I possibly can before handing over keys, but sometimes scheduling can be hectic, so if I'm unable to meet guests I will give  thorough instructions for arrival/departure. My main concern is that my guests arrive safely.

This is one of the coolest neighborhoods in Chicago. Historically a very popular tourist destination, the Uptown Square at the center of the Uptown Entertainment District which is home to various music venues, nightclubs, restaurants and shops. The Uptown Entertainment District is now experiencing a revival, with new restaurants and shops opening every year. Uptown is also a stop for Chicago Gangster tours, with many locations tied to infamous gangsters such as John Dillinger, Al Capone, Machine Gun Jack McGurn, Roger Touhy (""Terrible Touhy"") and others.

I am 2 blocks from the redline. I would advise against renting a car if you are visiting, there is just no reason. Train and most buses run 24 hours a day 7 days a week. If you do drive, street parking here is easy and free. Also my place is about a 10-15 minute walk to the lake and there are more divvy bikes stations than you can shake a stick at, but why would you shake a stick at a bike station; that's dumb.

No smoking. You wouldn't think I would need to write this but I guess it needs to be said, so no smoking or you will not get your security deposit back.

I'm available for questions 24/7 via phone but I tend to lead a pretty active lifestyle, the result of which is I'm not home much.  

I'm also a big coffee (though come summer it is mostly iced coffee) and matcha drinker and will be happy to make a cup or two for you if you let me know the night prior.

See the note in ""The Space"" section regarding how I may have to delegate some issues you encounter to my siblings or pals.

Bucktown/Wicker Park is a pretty happening spot.  All spots listed are less than a ten minute walk from the apartment unless otherwise noted:

For food and drink many of Eater's 38 essential restaurants are within walking distance and there are countless others that get lots of food press love (Paul Kahan's Big Star/Dove's Luncheonette/Cafe Cancale, Pub Royale, Piece Brewery and Pizzeria, Antique Taco, Stan's Doughnuts, The Delta, Small Cheval, Umami Burger, Le Bouchon, Craft Pizza, Furious Spoon, The Bristol).  

Beloved cocktail bar The Violet Hour is a short stumble away and iconic Chicago beer bar The Map Room is five minutes out by Divvy bike.  Stop by the Emporium Arcade Bar for a quality draft list and quality gaming.  For coffee check out the The Wormhole, Ipsento,  and La Colombe (The Wormhole has an entire Delorean inside of its relaxed environs and seriously impressive latte art).

Music venues within a five minute walk include The Subterranean and The Double Door.

Shop at the numerous stores on Damen and Milwaukee ranging for international brands to fun, independent boutiques.

Also, you are one block away from the newest Bucktown attraction, The 606.  The 606 is a 2.7 mile, $95 million trail/park that runs on an old freight track.  There are many places to sit and enjoy as well as numerous parks at entryways to the trails.  It's a great place to bike and walk even in winter.

There is free street parking that is well-lit, safe, and all around the apartment (I've never had to park more than two blocks away).  There is a Divvy bike-share station on the corner (Divvy is my primary form of transportation), the # 72 bus runs every ten minutes, the CTA's Blue Line is a five minute walk away, the Metra commuter rail is a 10 minute walk ), and there are cabs on North Avenue throughout the day (Uber/Lyft users can expect to have a car at the doorstep within five minutes 24 hours a day).  The apartment's close proximity to the highway means most fares to River North, Millennium Park or the Art Institute will run less than $15 on via ridesharing outside of rush hour traffic.

There is permitted street parking that is well-lit, safe, and generally close to the apartment.  There is a Divvy bike-share stations one, four, and six blocks away (Divvy is my primary form of transportation), the # 72 bus to Red Line trains runs every ten minutes just down the street on North Avenue, the CTA's Damen stop for Blue Line trains is a five minute walk away, the Metra commuter rail is a 10 minute walk, and there are cabs on North Avenue throughout the day (Uber/Lyft users can expect to have a car at the doorstep within five minutes 24 hours a day).  Download the Transit app to see the cost, directions, and time commitment for all the different modes of transit in one place.

I have a very early checkout to allow myself the time necessary to turn the room around and get to work on-time.  I'm totally flexible if there are no other guests arriving the day of your departure, and stashing bags in the living room (no matter if you're arriving early or departing late) is not a problem in the slightest.","Please try to pick up after yourselves by placing cups and dishes in the sink so I can clean them.   If you plan on bringing friends old or new by, that's a-okay if you ask in advance.  Smokers please use the patio. Leave the keys on the table where you found them on the way out (don't worry about bolting the door).  Please leave the door to your room slightly ajar when you're not around to let the airflow in and so I know I do not have to tiptoe around to avoid disturbing you.","I'm available for questions 24/7 via phone but I tend to lead a pretty active lifestyle, the result of which is I'm not home much.

7. Keep windows and exterior doors locked for safety.  Anyone that is reported by my tenants to have left any exterior doors open and/or unlocked will be given a warning and then a fine of $100, plus any other damages incurred as a result of theft.

8. Use the cover provided when using the microwave.

9. Lost key fee is $150 per key.  Lock out fee for exterior OR interior doors is $150 (that is if you leave your key in the unit and need to call me to let you back in). I do not have keys for interior doors that are locked.

10. At checkout, please hang all dirty towels on the over-the-door hooks in the bathrooms.

11. If more guests sleep at a location than the number originally stated in the booking, the security deposit will be charged in full.

12. If guests check out late, this delays the cleaners from beginning their cleaning at the predetermined check-out time so guests will be charged $50. Guests who are still in the apartment after 12 pm will be charged for an extra night. This does not apply if we have approved a late checkout in advance.

13.  Please make sure to turn off the A/C or lower the heat setting to 60 degrees when you are leaving the unit (both to go out temporarily or for the final checkout) to help save energy and high utility bills.

14.  Please use coasters and placemats provided and wipe up spills promptly so as to not cause water marks and stains on wood tables.

Being native locals, we can help you live like a local while you're here with recommendations for eats in Wicker Park (or elsewhere in the city), how to get around the city and things to do in Chicago.

You'll be minutes from I-90/94. Or if you prefer public transportation, you can take a 7-minute walk to the CTA Blue Line Damen stop to take you downtown in 10 minutes or take you to O'Hare Airport, or you can take one of several different buses.

The place is comfortable, tidy, and efficiently located on North Avenue in the heart of ultra-hip Wicker Park; Steps away from a thriving area full of popular restaurants, cafes, boutiques, concert venues, nightlife, etc.. There are convenient public transportation and Uber options to get all over the city, quickly and easily, from here also.

It is an expansive, high ceiling, three bedroom apartment, on the third floor of a building with a comedy bar below [Northbar  http://www.liveatnorthbar.com] - which often has hilarious performances. Everything you need for a comfortable stay is provided - full size beds, pillows, blankets, towels, toiletries, hair dryer, kitchen, washer & dryer, and tv & wifi are all accessible to enhance your stay.

The entire place, except for the other two bedrooms (because they MAY be occupied with other Airbnb guests), is available for your stay. However, please sleep in your bedroom (and not in the common areas).

I do not live at the apartment, yet I am nearby and available throughout your stay to recommend local attractions, dining, nightlife, and also answer questions that you may have.

“Wicker Park is famous for live music and nightlife, chef-driven restaurants and countless art galleries — many housed within the Flat Iron Arts Building. If you have an acute knowledge of craft cocktails or an affinity for coffee, plus want to sift through records or thrifted threads, there's no better area to sip and shop in the country.

The area has become a prevailing influence on Chicago's Michelin-rated, James Beard Award-winning dining scene, boasting some of the city's most sought after tables. Wicker Park and Bucktown are also known for their palate pleasing nightcaps, like renowned brewery Piece and mixology tour de force The Violet Hour.

Along North, Division, Milwaukee and Damen Avenues, you will find an unbelievable blend of vintage shops amid independently-owned boutiques touting fashions for both men and women, and luxury home goods and beauty products.

The area has become a prevailing influence on Chicago's Michelin-rated, James Beard Award-winning dining scene, boasting some of the city's most sought after tables. Wicker Park and Bucktown are also known for their palate pleasing nightcaps, like renowned brewery Piece and mixology tour de force The Violet Hour.

No Smoking
The home (and entire building including outdoor common areas) is designated as a strictly smoke-free community. There will be a $500 fee imposed if you choose to smoke in the building. Please respect our policy and step outside the vicinity.

The perfect location for a weekend getaway or business trip. River North is a stylish urban neighborhood that borders the Magnificent Mile and is just across the bridge from the Loop, Millennium Park, and the downtown theater district. It is the go-to neighborhood for those who appreciate fine art and design, but is also a little quieter than being right in the middle of downtown. For those who appreciate fine dining and drinks, you can find everything from knockout noodles and Spanish small plates to high-end steakhouses and famed pizzerias. Just about every type of cuisine is covered in this mix of award-winning restaurants and local favorites. And for a fun evening out, slip into any of the sleek new clubs, upscale wine bars and craft cocktail lounges, many of which are walking distance from the home.

NOTES: 
(1) REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY (see below)
(2) The host typically would like to greet the guests in person, occasionally this may not be possible.  In the latter case, please contact the host for the procedure of ""Self Check-in"". 
(3) Let the host know if you plan to drive so the parking matter can be addressed if needed.

REASONS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE THIS PLACE TO STAY
Guests choose a place to stay based what it serves them the best.  We would like to highlight a few items worth considering and invite you to book this place.
(a) We run a very efficient operation and have a very competitive room rate with high quality rooms and services;
(b) This house has an exceptional great location.  It is about 10 minutes to a Green Line Station by walking (hence very close to downtown Chicago) and has convenient access to west, north west, and south west of greater Chicagoland by car.
(c) Free parking is provided.  Parking can be very very expensive in any larger metropolitan, including downtown Chicago.  Therefore it is much more economical to park here and take the train to downtown Chicago. If you rent a room in or near downtown Chicago, you implicitly or explicitly spend a lot of money just on parking.
(d) The ""Occupancy Tax"" is about 11% here which is much less than 23% or higher (doubled) in Chicago. The occupancy tax is paid by the guests based on the sum of room rate and cleaning fee.  With this tax and parking cost in mind, it is much more economical (and without losing convenient access to downtown Chicago) to stay in a convenient suburbs rather than in Chicago or downtown Chicago. Since the ""Occupancy Tax"" is waived if you stay 31 days or longer, you can avoid this tax and save quite a bit of money if you plan your trip ahead and check with the host for room availability.

====== Other Information  ========
Cereal, waffles and coffee are provided by the host for the ARRIVAL day/night of the guests. A full service restaurant (Blue Max Cafe) is only a block north of the house (serves breakfast and lunch only). Various fast food and slow food restaurants are also very close.  A great oriental message service is just couple blocks south of the house (not too expensive, please get coupon from the host for one-time discount).

The house is the middle of Oak Park and Forest Park downtown (almost equal distance).  You have access to 24 hours super markets, and all sorts of other stores and entertainment in both downtown, plus big Chicago downtown of course. Come to stay in the house, and enjoy both the big Chicago, and friendly cute downtown in both Oak Park and Forest Park.",,,,,"NOTES:

Experience Kenwood, one of the City's loveliest neighborhoods with tree-lined streets and beautiful single family homes. We are very close to Lake Michigan and the City's museums. The University of Chicago is nearby as are restaurants and shops.

Walk two blocks to the stop for express buses that carry passengers to Chicago's downtown or three blocks to an electric train that speeds it way to the Chicago Loop. Density in Kenwood is low, therefore, street parking is plentiful.","If you order out or bring in food, please eat at either the dining room, kitchen table or weather permitting, balcony. Sorry, there are no cooking privileges other than making tea or coffee in the morning and enjoying toast, English muffin or banana bread, when I've made it, for breakfast. You always may help yourself to water and ice from the refrigerator door.

An incredibly popular neighborhood destination, largely because of its close proximity to the lake and downtown, Old Town keeps up a lively pace day and night. Victorian-era buildings, brick alleyways and narrow, tree-lined streets are charming backdrops to a busy main strip that runs along Wells Street between North Avenue and Division Street.

Uber is extremely efficient, but the CTA Red, Purple & Brown 'L' Train or numerous CTA Bus Stops are a 5-minute walk.

Street Parking is Permit Only.  Permits can be provided at no charge.  Covered garage parking available for $10 per night.

Unit is located on the 3rd Floor (essentially 2nd, as the 1st Floor are garden units). There is no elevator, so it may not be suitable for people who cannot climb stairs.  Non-ADA Accessible. Our family also includes a very friendly and hypoallergenic dog.

Check-In Rules:
Unfortunately, I will not always be able to personally meet all guests at their desired check in time.

If I'm unable to meet you, I'll provide the Digital Door Lock Code with very detailed instructions for entry which will be messaged through Airbnb messenger at your Check-In time. You'll be given instant access to the building whenever you arrive! Please TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF upon entering the home. 

Food and Beverages:
There is absolutely NO consumption of food or beverages (excluding water) outside of the kitchen, kitchen bar, and dining room.

All food and beverages in the fridge and kitchen cabinets belong to other guests and your host. Refrain from taking food/beverages that were not brought in or purchased by you. Coffee, creamer, and sugar on the coffee bar in the kitchen are complimentary and you may have as much of it as you'd like. 

Guest Policy:
""Guest"" constitutes any person entering the property, whether spending the night or only visiting. Unverified, unauthorized guests are not allowed on the premises. If you'd like to have a guest during your stay, your guest MUST be verified and announced through the AirBnb messenger and approval of this guest must be explicitly given by us, the hosts. Violation of this rule will result in immediate cancellation of your reservation and termination of your stay. 

Mail:
Please notify the host if you want to have Mail/Parcels shipped to you during your stay.

Quiet Hours:
Quiet Hours at the residence are between the hours of 10pm and 7am Sunday-Thursday and 12am and 7am on Friday-Saturday.

This is a Shared Space with many Travelers all visiting Chicago for a different purpose.  Having common courtesy is more than enough to fulfill this rule.  If you're a Late Night personality, please respect those waking up early for work.  If you're up at the crack of dawn, please get ready as quietly as possible as to not disturb those still asleep.

Smoking:
There is absolutely no smoking inside of the building.  This includes Electronic Cigarettes and all other forms of Tobacco.

Travelers are more than welcome to Smoke outside of the building.  


Weapons:
Absolutely NO WEAPONS of any sort are allowed inside of the building.  This includes Firearms, Knives, and anything else that can be used in a malicious manner.  Host(s) will have Final Say in what constitutes as a weapon.

Violence:
There will be no violence of any sort tolerated inside of the building.  This includes Physical Violence, Verbal (Arguing, Threats, Intimidation, etc.), and any sort of behavior that causes another person in the house to feel upset. 

‘Common Sense’ Rule:
As this is a Shared Building, guests are expected to act in a way which is both Respectful and Inviting to everyone else sharing the space.

This is a Shared Space with many Travelers all visiting Chicago for a different purpose.  Having common courtesy is more than enough to fulfill this rule.

Jefferson Park is known as ""The Gateway to Chicago."" It has long been thought of as a transportation hub connecting the Northwest Suburbs to the City. People who want the convenience of suburban parking lots and availability of chain stores will be able to find what they need in the nearby suburbs. Those who want to spend their time downtown and use public transportation will also have great options. For those who want a little of both, it is ideal. The neighborhood itself is a quiet community of mostly long-term Chicago residents. Local shopping and restaurants are available within easy walking distance. 

There are also nearby forest preserves with trails for running, walking, or bike riding. If you look closely you may find a family of deer! There are also three public parks within a 2 mile radius. Two of the parks have free public pools. Please ask if you would like to see the schedules.

occupies the entire third floor, which includes 3 bedrooms, a bathroom, full kitchen and ballroom. There is an additional bedroom on the second floor that can be included with an extra rental fee. 

(Upon availability, bedrooms can be booked singularly, for one or two guests. In that case, the bathroom and kitchen might be shared with other guests.  If the second floor bedroom is rented singularly, there is no kitchen access.)

There is a separate entrance and guests take the back staircase to the third floor. The third floor area is totally private and the host does not use nor access this space while you are a guest.

Bicycles (two adult, one child and a Tandem) and (2) beach passes are available for your enjoyment.

Guests can use other parts of the house or garden for small events or private get togethers. For instance, enjoy high tea, cocktails or wine and cheese on the outside terrace or have a private dinner catered in the grand dining room. Gardens can be used for anything from a formal wedding to a casual barbecue. Please inquire for rates and options available.

*There is no access to the first and second floor, unless they have been rented separately for an event or added experience.","Stay in the Guest Suite of this exquisitely restored Historic Landmark Manor House, one block to Lake Michigan's beaches and close to town and NU. Enjoy the entire third floor, which includes three bedrooms, a private bath with claw-foot soaking tub and shower, private kitchen with full amenities, and a ballroom, in case you feel like dancing! The ballroom can be equipped with a couch and air mattress for any extra guests. Also available is an additional second floor bedroom for a sixth guest.

The Guest Suite is situated in a beautiful historic Manor House built in 1914 and designed by famed architect Earnest Mayo. The entire house was restored to its original splendor and has since won several awards and been seen on TV and in movies. The house is both a National and Evanston landmark and is situated in the Lakeshore Historic District. The guest suite occupies the entire restored third floor (apx 2500 sq ft), which includes three bedrooms, a bathroom, full kitchen and a ballroom. 

There is also a single bedroom on the second floor that can be used for an extra guest. Please inquire regarding fees.

The house and gardens can also be rented for private parties and small gatherings. Please inquire for details and pricing. Additional documentation in the form of an agreement regarding pricing and rules for use of the space will require signature, if interested.

The host respects the privacy of their guests and therefore, is fairly hands-off. However, any special requests can be made in advance or upon arrival and we are always only a text away with any questions or desires you may have 24/7.

We are located in the heart of Evanston's Lakeshore Historic district, only one block to the best beaches, with all that the lakefront has to offer; including boat and paddle board rentals, tennis, fitness trail, running/cycling paths and concessions. We are a short walk to NU and town, which includes grocery, coffee shops, restaurants, movie theatre, antique and boutique shops and other attractions.

We are in a very walkable neighborhood and bicycles are available, as well. Evanston also has public Divvy bikes to rent. If venturing to downtown Chicago for a meeting or sightseeing, you can use either the el train/CTA (like a subway but elevated) or Metra train. The stop for either is a short walk. There is also a CTA bus to the mall. Car rentals, taxi's and Uber are also readily available. If coming from the airport, the easiest method is Uber and more cost effective than a taxi. However, the most inexpensive is the el train.

License #","Smoking is not allowed in, on or within 25 feet of the property. This is out of respect to our neighbors.

You are limited to the number of guests listed in your reservation (max 5 without an additional guest charge). There is a maximum of 4 extra guests allowed with an extra fee. Only registered guests may enter the property, without prior consent of the host.

Check- in is with the host between 3:00 - 5:00PM. We can usually accommodate earlier or later check in. Please arrange this with your host after booking. If there are multiple people in your party, please note that the host will only greet the people that arrive during check-in time. After that, your first arrival will have to greet your remaining party members who arrive past the check-in time. We can accommodate previous guests who have stayed before with lock box check-in for arrivals at or after the check-in time.

There is a $200 fee for any lost key or key that is not returned prior to check out.

Each guest is provided with a set of towels for use during their stay. Towels must be left onsite upon departure. There is a replacement fee for any towels not returned prior to check out. 

Any damaged or missing items will incur a replacement fee after check out.

By booking, the guests agree to the house rules and agree to read the house manual and follow all rules therein. The guests understand that if any rules are not adhered to that they may be asked to leave immediately and will not receive a refund for any part of their booking.

Guests renting additional rooms or space in the house or gardens will be provided with documentation in the form of an agreement regarding details, pricing and additional rules for use of that space. The above rules apply for rentals of any kind.

Please text us with any needs, questions or emergencies that occur before or after arrival.

The room available is actually the entire second floor of a house, best for groups or those who require a large space for themselves! The first floor has a living room, kitchen, and bathroom. The basement has a clothing washer/dryer.

Located in a nice neighborhood not far from downtown Chicago and airports. This is NOT a hotel. The experience you will have here reflects my suburban Chicago home!

MUST BE DOG-FRIENDLY! The host and his canine companion reside on the first floor of the house.

The space available is on the second floor of the house. Included is access to a personal heater, air conditioner, and pedestal fan for keeping your space comfortable and climate controlled to your liking. The first floor has a common living room with couch and TV, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a private bedroom that the host uses. There are newly finished hardwood floors throughout all the rooms, with tile in the bathroom and kitchen. The basement has a clothing washer and dryer, but there is also a very nice laundromat across the street! Out in the backyard is a patio and grill.

A smaller second bedroom on the first floor of the house is also listed on AirBnB, therefore there may be another group of guests in the house at the same time.

Guests can access the first floor kitchen, bathroom, and living-room, as well as the clothing washer and dryer in the basement.

The host resides on the first floor of the house, but physical availability will depend on the day. Socialization, questions, or concerns will be best through text messaging.

Berwyn is a quiet family suburb right outside of Chicago. The infamous historic route 66 that connects Chicago to California runs through (known as Ogden avenue). It's located between O'Hare and Midway international airport, making both relatively easy to access!

Common near-by attractions include the ""Galloping Ghost"" arcade in Brookfield, the top-ranking Brookfield zoo, Freedom and Proksa parks in Berwyn. Tours through the Frank Lloyd Wright home and studio, as well as one of homes of writer Ernest Hemmingway are available in Oak Park.

Close proximity to lots of classic Chicago pizzerias like Lou Malgnati's makes getting a taste of Chicago's finest easy! Other good restaurant include Paisans for pizza/bar food and Lalo's for Mexican.

For those looking to drink, there is a bar down the street, but the best bars in town are ""Cigars and Stripes"", and ""James Joyce"", both on Ogden, and ""Fitzgerald's"" on Roosevelt if you're in the mood for music.

Located a little more than 2 miles away from the Stevenson expressway, travel downtown or to further-away suburbs is made easy!

Available on location is shared drive-way parking.

There's also a Metra BNSF station located only 1.0 mile north that can take you to Union Station, downtown. The pink line is 3.6 miles northeast and goes to the loop, downtown. The blue line is 4.3 miles north and goes through downtown before heading to O'Hare airport.

Parking of guest vehicles will usually be done in the driveway on the right side of the house. If there are multiples vehicles from multiple guests, an optimal parking situation will be determined by the host through communication with both parties.","Smoking allowed outside only.

*Do not leave hair in the shower.
*Do not use others' personal products/items without explicit permission.

Failure to abide by house rules may be grounds for a  no-refund cancellation of booking or additional fee.","The host resides on the first floor of the house, but physical availability will depend on the day. Socialization, questions, or concerns will be best through text messaging.","Berwyn is a quiet family suburb right outside of Chicago. The infamous historic route 66 that connects Chicago to California runs through (known as Ogden avenue). It's located between O'Hare and Midway international airport, making both relatively easy to access!

Common near-by attractions include the ""Galloping Ghost"" arcade in Brookfield, the top-ranking Brookfield zoo, Freedom and Proksa parks in Berwyn. Tours through the Frank Lloyd Wright home and studio, as well as one of homes of writer Ernest Hemmingway are available in Oak Park.

Close proximity to lots of classic Chicago pizzerias like Lou Malgnati's makes getting a taste of Chicago's finest easy! Other good restaurant include Paisans for pizza/bar food and Lalo's for Mexican.

For those looking to drink, there is a bar down the street, but the best bars in town are ""Cigars and Stripes"", and ""James Joyce"", both on Ogden, and ""Fitzgerald's"" on Roosevelt if you're in the mood for music.","Parking of guest vehicles will usually be done in the driveway on the right side of the house. If there are multiples vehicles from multiple guests, an optimal parking situation will be determined by the host through communication with both parties.","MUST BE DOG-FRIENDLY! The host and his canine companion reside on the first floor of the house.

The space available is on the second floor of the house. Included is access to a personal heater, air conditioner, and pedestal fan for keeping your space comfortable and climate controlled to your liking. The first floor has a common living room with couch and TV, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a private bedroom that the host uses. There are newly finished hardwood floors throughout all the rooms, with tile in the bathroom and kitchen. The basement has a clothing washer and dryer, but there is also a very nice laundromat across the street! Out in the backyard is a patio and grill.

A smaller second bedroom on the first floor of the house is also listed on AirBnB, therefore there may be another group of guests in the house at the same time.","MUST BE DOG-FRIENDLY! The host and his canine companion reside on the first floor of the house.

The room available is actually the entire second floor of a house, best for groups or those who require a large space for themselves! The first floor has a living room, kitchen, and bathroom. The basement has a clothing washer/dryer.

Located in a nice neighborhood not far from downtown Chicago and airports. This is NOT a hotel. The experience you will have here reflects my suburban Chicago home!","Located a little more than 2 miles away from the Stevenson expressway, travel downtown or to further-away suburbs is made easy!

Available on location is shared drive-way parking.

There's also a Metra BNSF station located only 1.0 mile north that can take you to Union Station, downtown. The pink line is 3.6 miles northeast and goes to the loop, downtown.

I love providing travel tips! I'll be coming and going to work M-F from about 8:45a to 6:30p and some evenings I have improv class. Saturday mornings I have comedy writing class, too. I'm happy to chat with you or leave you alone. My cat is also very friendly but can be shut out of your room.

Please reach out if you need anything :) Texting me directly will be the fastest way to reach me.

The neighborhood is super artsy and fun, great for foodies. Fantastic dive bar on corner with a Michelob Light sign hanging out front and partial walls- they have karaoke on the weekends. 

Delicious Kyrgyz restaurant called Jibek Jolu on Lincoln. Amazing food, BYOB. Pho’s Spicier Thai Cuisine is fantastic. 

Grind is a great coffee shop around the corner on Lincoln. 

Davis Theater (movies) around corner on Lincoln. 

A block south is Welles Park, which is beautiful grounds for hanging out, picnicking and bocce ball. Also a super cool restored wildflower prairie land corner. 

Check out the actual Lincoln Square, too- it has bookstores, restaurants, ice cream, a European grocery store, acupuncture, and festivals and farmers markets at different times.

Super easy to get around via public transportation! 3 min walk to Western Brown Line stop (30 min ride to downtown Chi)! Minutes to bus connections via 49, 78, and 50. Divvy/Lyft bikeshare stations also nearby. Street parking available.

Please read this before reserving our property:

Be very clear about your intentions when booking our home. There are to be absolutely no parties or outside guests other than those stated clearly in your reservation. Be very clear about the number of guests you are hosting in our property. If this rule is violated, we will have your entire reservation cancelled and your group removed from the property immediately without refund. Do not let this happen to you. We do not like surprises, and want to ensure all expectations are clear so everyone can enjoy their stay! By booking our property, you are agreeing to the contract below in its entirety:

Guest agrees to comply with all Terms and Conditions stated below, which are an essential part of this Agreement; Guest acknowledges he/she has read, understands, and is familiar with all Terms and Conditions.

Guest entering this Agreement represents himself/herself as agent for all parties occupying the Unit during the period of occupancy by Guest. Guest booking this unit must be at least 25 years of age and will be responsible for all other persons occupying the Unit and/or any other person(s) from time to time present in the Unit, for compliance with this Agreement, listed policies, ordinances, rules and regulations, and for any losses incurred by Owner and/or Manager or to the Unit due to the activities of any such persons, whether intentional, negligent, or otherwise.

ADDITIONAL OCCUPANTS: This unit can accommodate a maximum of the number of 6 guests; provided, however, that the overnight occupants of the Unit will be limited to those persons listed as occupants in the reservation. Guest acknowledges and agrees that in the event that more than the agreed number of occupants spend the night at the Unit, or more than the agreed number occupants are at any given time inside the Unit, this Agreement will be immediately terminated, the Unit must be vacated and the entire amount of the Rental Fees and Security Deposit provided by Guest will be forfeited, in addition to any costs associated with legal remedies that may be necessary.

PARTIES AND NOISE: Quite hours must be respected (10PM-8AM.) Parties and/or events of any kind are strictly prohibited at the Unit. For the purposes of this Agreement, Owner and/or Manager will consider that there is a party inside the Unit whenever the number of daytime occupants in the Unit exceeds the number of guests outlined in the reservation. Notwithstanding the former provision, even if the number of guests is not exceeded, all other common definitions of a party will be accepted, whenever the noise level inside the Unit is beyond what is reasonably accepted as normal. Any violation of this rule will result in an immediate termination of the reservations and this Agreement will be immediately terminated, the Unit must be vacated and the entire amount of the Fees and Security Deposit will be forfeited, in addition to any costs associated with legal remedies that may be necessary.

One of Chicago's creative epicenters lies just outside downtown Chicago in Wicker Park and Bucktown. These synonymous neighborhoods are famous for live music and nightlife, chef-driven restaurants and countless art galleries — many housed within the Flat Iron Arts Building. If you have an acute knowledge of craft cocktails or an affinity for coffee, plus want to sift through records or thrifted threads, there's no better area to sip and shop in the country.

The area has become a prevailing influence on Chicago's Michelin-rated, James Beard Award-winning dining scene, boasting some of the city's most sought after tables. Wicker Park and Bucktown are also known for their palate-pleasing nightcaps like renowned brewery Piece and mixology tour de force The Violet Hour.

Along North, Division, Milwaukee and Damen Avenues, you will find an unbelievable blend of vintage shops amid independently-owned boutiques touting fashions for both men and women, and luxury home goods and beauty products. On the same blocks are nationally-recognized names in fashion, and a mix of major retail chains that have also set up shop to satisfy the on-trend crowds.

The Western blue line train stop is about a 10-15 min walk and will give you easy access to the airport and downtown. If you have your own car,  highway 90/94 is 10 mins away. 

There are also plenty of Ubers/Lyfts around if needed!

There is free street parking alongside our street. Because this is a loft, the ceiling height is a little low upstairs where the bedroom is. If you are 6' and over, you will have to crouch upstairs. Sorry about this inconvenience, we hope you still find the place adequate!","PLEASE NOTE THAT WE CHARGE PER GUEST AFTER A SET NUMBER.

If you have an acute knowledge of craft cocktails or an affinity for coffee, plus want to sift through records or thrifted threads, there's no better area to sip and shop in the country.

The area has become a prevailing influence on Chicago's Michelin-rated, James Beard Award-winning dining scene, boasting some of the city's most sought after tables. Wicker Park and Bucktown are also known for their palate-pleasing nightcaps like renowned brewery Piece and mixology tour de force The Violet Hour.

Along North, Division, Milwaukee and Damen Avenues, you will find an unbelievable blend of vintage shops amid independently-owned boutiques touting fashions for both men and women, and luxury home goods and beauty products. On the same blocks are nationally-recognized names in fashion, and a mix of major retail chains that have also set up shop to satisfy the on-trend crowds.","There is free street parking alongside our street. Because this is a loft, the ceiling height is a little low upstairs where the bedroom is. If you are 6' and over, you will have to crouch upstairs. Sorry about this inconvenience, we hope you still find the place adequate!","Our space has all that's needed for your trip! As you walk-in to the unit, you'll notice the high ceilings and spacious atmosphere of the apartment. The living room is equipped with a couch that can sleep 1 and also a smart TV giving you access to Netflix, Hulu and more for all your streaming needs. We thoughtfully designed the space with pieces of decor to give an artsy vibe. 

To the left of the living room is our fully-stocked, simple kitchen for you to cook a meal if needed. Adjacent is a full bathroom for your use.

Your massive king sized bed is upstairs in the lofted part of the apartment. There is a desk as well in case you would like to get some work done!",Welcome to our artsy 1 BDR loft in Wicker Park! Enjoy a cozy room to yourself or with a small group on a quiet tree lined street as you explore Chicago or get some work done on a business trip! You are near the blue line train for easy access to O'Hare airport and downtown if needed.  A brand new walking trail is nearby if you're looking for a scenic walk in our beautiful city and you're near plenty of nightlife and restaurants!,"The Western blue line train stop is about a 10-15 min walk and will give you easy access to the airport and downtown. If you have your own car,  highway 90/94 is 10 mins away.

"Our goal is to make sure everyone is treated fairly and in consideration of others, so there are just a few things to be aware of so everyone has a great stay.

While you have a private bedroom, please keep in mind that others will want to use the common areas after you, so please don't leave them your mess. Also, if you happen to break something or something isn't working right, please let me know so I can fix it right away. Also, it's a shared kitchen, so please don't eat/drink food that isn't yours, if you need advice on where to buy food in the neighborhood, just ask.

Overall, the best way to think about how you should treat a home on airBNB is just like the camping rule: ""Leave no trace"".

Quiet times for the lower, 2nd/3rd floors is after 10pm on weeknights, midnight on weekends. It's a big space however (~7000 sq ft) and you are welcome to use the common areas late as needed as long as you are respectful of other guests. We simply ask that you to leave things how you found them.

Also, NO PARTIES, NO EVENTS, NO PHOTOSHOOTS. Do not book if you are planning on one. Both myself and staff live at the house full time, so please don't create a difficult situation for us. Having some drinks, playing pool, and casual gatherings for dinner, etc. is of course welcomed and encouraged (and in many cases others in the house may join you if welcomed!). But if you are inviting more then a friend or two that aren't staying with you at the house as part of your reservation, or create a disruption for other guests, your reservation will be cancelled without refund and you will be forced to vacate the premises immediately.

Please be sure to declare the correct number of guests for your stay. If you have anyone doing anything more then meeting you exclusively in the common areas, they need to be a registered guest. If you are found to have others with you that are not part of your guest count on airbnb, your reservation will be cancelled immediately, and without refund due to fee circumvention which is in direct violation of airBNB's terms of service.

For the safety of everyone, the home security system includes cameras that are installed in/around the home. This helps to protect your personal belongings while you are out, and increases your personal safety during your stay. They record everyone coming to/from the home, and monitor all of the common/public areas around the home. Please note that cameras are NOT installed in any private areas of the home, including bedrooms/bathrooms. The security setup is identical to those used at any boutique hotel or similar property where there are multiple guests occupying a single shared space.

Also, keep in mind that East Garfield Park is a neighborhood undergoing urban renewal. It's still a majority minority area with pockets of poverty which can be unsettling for some, but after living here for five years and hosting over 1000 guests on Airbnb, there have been no incidents of crime that have impacted me or any guests staying here. Many guests have actually commented on the fact that they were very glad for the opportunity to live in a real neighborhood of Chicago that was less then 20 minutes from downtown, giving them an opportunity away from the touristy areas when they wanted.

Like any area, with the exception of a few people everyone is generally friendly and helpful, please be respectful and treat everyone with respect, and they will gladly do so in return.",2.5 shared

This includes the kitchen, dining room, billiards room, parlor, laundry room, and of course common bathrooms.","This room is in the lower level of Fort Washington, a Richardsonian Romanesque mansion. Brick/Limestone walls create a cozy room a perfect retreat after a long day in Chicago. Sleeps up to 4 people on the king bed with sleeper sofa.

Easy unmetered street parking is readily available for those coming by car.

Full size kitchen, multiple living/outdoor areas, and laundry machines are available for use as well.

My other rooms are listed here: https://www.airbnb.com/users/22608682/listings

The space is in an old victorian era (c.1895) limestone/brick mansion located on Chicago's west side in the East Garfield Park neighborhood. It overlooks Washington Blvd. and is about a block from the Kedzie Green Line Train.

Please note if you book, this is an old house, with over 125 years of living. This means lumps, bumps, scratches, and things in general that are less then perfect. Most people enjoy this character of a house, and it's why they book.

I allow LUGGAGE DROP OFF! You can store your luggage in the closet before check-in and after check-out times, you can drop it off and pick it up as early and as late as you would like. Public transit options (train, bus, bike share) available about a block away.

The entire home except remaining private rooms are available. This includes the kitchen, dining room, billiards room, parlor, laundry room, and of course common bathrooms.

While I live at the house, there is a chance we may never cross paths during your stay due to the size of the home. 

I'm always available via messages/phone, so if anything comes up, let me know! I assume everything is going well unless it's brought to my attention.

I'm happy to provide advice on where to eat, how to get around, and where to shop, just ask!

The area itself is undergoing redevelopment. This doesn't mean boutique coffee instead of national chain coffee, it means Chicago and it’s outlying neighborhoods are mixed bags, on my block you’ll have $500,000 homes next to a boarded up one. 

If you are looking for a great place close to everything but with tons of room typically unknown for a city house, this is it. 

The house is very close to the Garfield Park Conservatory for reference.  You'll need to order delivery or take a train for restaurants, but it's all less then 20 minutes away.

The house is about 1 block from the Kedzie green line station. It’s 20 minutes from downtown and about 45 from either airport. There is ample street parking in front of the home for those arriving by car.

I mention this in the neighborhood section of my listing as well, but it's worth repeating here. 

Please do your research and know where you are booking. I've lived here for over 7 years and never had a concern for my own safety or that of the thousands of my guests.

Also, please note that I don't have keyed locks on interior doors of the home. If this is a problem for you, please don't book. I trust you, the guest, with my single most valuable asset and all of my personal belongings. I have never been given a reason to doubt that trust in this community, but if you plan on breaking that trust, please don't book.","Our goal is to make sure everyone is treated fairly and in consideration of others, so there are just a few things to be aware of so everyone has a great stay.

Also, if you happen to break something or something isn't working right, please let me know so I can fix it right away. Also, it's a shared kitchen, so please don't eat/drink food that isn't yours, if you need advice on where to buy food in the neighborhood, just ask.

Overall, the best way to think about how you should treat a home on airBNB is just like the camping rule: ""Leave no trace"".

Quiet times for the lower, 2nd/3rd floors is after 10pm on weeknights, midnight on weekends. It's a big space however (~7000 sq ft) and you are welcome to use the common areas late as needed as long as you are respectful of other guests. We simply ask that you to leave things how you found them.

Also, NO PARTIES, NO EVENTS, NO PHOTOSHOOTS. Do not book if you are planning on one. Both myself and staff live at the house full time, so please don't create a difficult situation for us. Having some drinks, playing pool, and casual gatherings for dinner, etc. is of course welcomed and encouraged (and in many cases others in the house may join you if welcomed!). But if you are inviting more then a friend or two that aren't staying with you at the house as part of your reservation, or create a disruption for other guests, your reservation will be cancelled without refund and you will be forced to vacate the premises immediately.

Please be sure to declare the correct number of guests for your stay. If you have anyone doing anything more then meeting you exclusively in the common areas, they need to be a registered guest. If you are found to have others with you that are not part of your guest count on airbnb, your reservation will be cancelled immediately, and without refund due to fee circumvention which is in direct violation of airBNB's terms of service.

For the safety of everyone, the home security system includes cameras that are installed in/around the home. This helps to protect your personal belongings while you are out, and increases your personal safety during your stay. They record everyone coming to/from the home, and monitor all of the common/public areas around the home. Please note that cameras are NOT installed in any private areas of the home, including bedrooms/bathrooms. The security setup is identical to those used at any boutique hotel or similar property where there are multiple guests occupying a single shared space.

Also, keep in mind that East Garfield Park is a neighborhood undergoing urban renewal. It's still a majority minority area with pockets of poverty which can be unsettling for some, but after living here for five years and hosting over 1000 guests on Airbnb, there have been no incidents of crime that have impacted me or any guests staying here. Many guests have actually commented on the fact that they were very glad for the opportunity to live in a real neighborhood of Chicago that was less then 20 minutes from downtown, giving them an opportunity away from the touristy areas when they wanted.

Like any area, with the exception of a few people everyone is generally friendly and helpful, please be respectful and treat everyone with respect, and they will gladly do so in return.","While I live at the house, there is a chance we may never cross paths during your stay due to the size of the home. 

I'm always available via messages/phone, so if anything comes up, let me know! I assume everything is going well unless it's brought to my attention.

I'm happy to provide advice on where to eat, how to get around, and where to shop, just ask!","The area itself is undergoing redevelopment. This doesn't mean boutique coffee instead of national chain coffee, it means Chicago and it’s outlying neighborhoods are mixed bags, on my block you’ll have $500,000 homes next to a boarded up one. 

If you are looking for a great place close to everything but with tons of room typically unknown for a city house, this is it. 

The house is very close to the Garfield Park Conservatory for reference.  You'll need to order delivery or take a train for restaurants, but it's all less then 20 minutes away.","I mention this in the neighborhood section of my listing as well, but it's worth repeating here. 

Please do your research and know where you are booking. I've lived here for over 7 years and never had a concern for my own safety or that of the thousands of my guests.

Also, please note that I don't have keyed locks on interior doors of the home. If this is a problem for you, please don't book. I trust you, the guest, with my single most valuable asset and all of my personal belongings. I have never been given a reason to doubt that trust in this community, but if you plan on breaking that trust, please don't book.","The space is in an old victorian era (c.1895) limestone/brick mansion located on Chicago's west side in the East Garfield Park neighborhood. It overlooks Washington Blvd. and is about a block from the Kedzie Green Line Train.

Please note if you book, this is an old house, with over 125 years of living. This means lumps, bumps, scratches, and things in general that are less then perfect. Most people enjoy this character of a house, and it's why they book.

I allow LUGGAGE DROP OFF! You can store your luggage in the closet before check-in and after check-out times, you can drop it off and pick it up as early and as late as you would like. Public transit options (train, bus, bike share) available about a block away.","This room is in the lower level of Fort Washington, a Richardsonian Romanesque mansion. Brick/Limestone walls create a cozy room a perfect retreat after a long day in Chicago. Sleeps up to 4 people on the king bed with sleeper sofa.

Easy unmetered street parking is readily available for those coming by car.

This place is very close to Downtown Chicago, and west loop where you can find  amazing restaurants and good bars, public transportation (buses ) are pretty close too!

The style of everything inside the house is modern, cozy and minimalist! It’s a great place if you wan to be close of the Chicago’s most common attractions but our rooms are small and also common areas.. We selected a kind of frame where you can put your luggage under it if you want to have more space . Also our rooms has a small portable organizer or a closet, a tiny table and stool and a table lamp.

Parking is such a tough situation in Chicago. In this spot you will need either to rent our private spot or to have the stickers for parking on the street ! Just make sure 1) you read all signs posted in the street/ trees or fences that says information about street cleaning , reparation, disabilities parking, school days, permit parking, etc 2) you are not over the crosswalk, near a hydrant, or wrong way.

If you want save some money and being right in front United Center and close to downtown, surrounding great public transportation this could be a great option for you!

I work at home in the unit above and am available if problems arise either with the facility or for general information about surrounding facilities for example (Loyola, Mac Neal and Oak Park hospitals within in mile of the property; CTA rapid transit with UIC and O'Hare connections only a 10 to 15 minute walk).

Forest Park is a quiet community with a diverse population. In fourteen years here, I have not experienced any security problems. People around me are friendly.

However, it first makes a loop through Chicago's primary commercial center (9 miles due East) and it is thus convenient to State Street and N. Michigan Ave. Shopping as well as a number of Museums, Grant Park activities. and River tourist attractions.  By car, you have quick access to the the 290 expressway (Chicgo's belt line) and within a fifteen mile radius you can travel to Oak Brook in the west, O'Hare (NW), with other good roads to MidWay (SE), Skokie to the North of Chicago and Oak Lawn to the South.  Locally their is one grocery store less than half a block south and and another two blocks north.  The shopping center to the south also includes   a WalMart , a fitness center and numerous fast food restaurants along Roosevelt Rd.. In the Summer, the Forest Park Swimming Pool, water park and Tennis courts are five blocks due north. The Forest Park Library is also close by-just north of the expressway and the Forest Park CTA station.

Anchored by a beautiful stretch of shoreline to the east and dotted with train stops from two ‘L' lines, Lakeview is one of Chicago's liveliest and most accessible neighborhoods. Several distinct areas — East Lakeview, Central Lakeview, Boystown and Wrigleyville — meld together to form a lakefront community that celebrates diversity and boasts something for every type of visitor.

Hit the bustling commercial districts along Belmont Avenue, Lincoln Avenue, Southport Avenue, Clark Street, Halsted Street and Broadway Street to shop — be it for vintage frocks, designer jeans or leather biker gear — or live it up with the locals at the seemingly endless options for bars and pubs, and the dozens of celebrated restaurants in between.

Arts and culture come in the form of live music venues, several summer street festivals and a thriving scene for theater, dance and comedy (Belmont Theater District is a stellar collection of nearly 20 independent companies).

Not to be outdone by its extraordinary entertainment landscape, Lakeview makes full use of its slice of Lincoln Park, a 1,200-acre oasis dedicated to the outdoors. Here you will find the scenic Lakefront Trail, a golf course and driving range, a boat harbor, a bird sanctuary, tennis courts and grassy playing fields that are also perfect for picnics or just soaking in the views.

Easy access (7 minute walk!) to the Red/Brown/Purple line trains with transit all over the city, as well as many bus lines.

The best point about this place is how close It’s to Downtown (15 min-public transportation, 10 min-car) If you going to a Event at United Center it’s so close as well( 10 min walking). The location it’s perfect to those who goes to an interview/ research/ work at Rush Medical Center, Cook County Hospital, John H Stroger, Jr.

The room is private but you will share common areas (pool table, kitchen , living room, and the 3 bathrooms ) with other Airbnb guests. Usually none of this get crowd becase most of Airbnb people are most of the time outside the house knowing the city, in concerts, interviews, etc, and they don’t spend much time in the house. A private apartment in the area usually cost over 120$ p/night plus taxes and fees which is in total almost 200$ p/night ! If you want save some money and being close to downtown, surrounding great public transportation and with free street parking this could be a great option for you! 

The room has a good size for the Queen size bed it has. If you want to add 3 or 4 people in the reservation I could add and extra air mattress for you with no extra charge, but then the room will become smaller for luggage becase you will have two beds on it. This is a good option if you want to save even more money otherwise you can book two rooms! 

As most of United States Houses this is not made with concrete so you will hear people walking. It doesn’t bother most of the people but if you are a very light sleeper you should choose a modern apartment (three floor apartments or traditional houses all has the same problem) or have an earphone or something for block the sound.","1.
